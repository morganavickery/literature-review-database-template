1,Rethinking Intensive Quantities via Guided Mediated Abduction,Abrahamson,2012,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Some intensive quantities, such as slope, velocity, or likelihood, are perceptually privileged in the sense that they are experienced as holistic, irreducible sensations. However, the formal expression of these quantities uses a/b analytic metrics; for example, the slope of a line is the quotient of its rise and run. Thus, whereas students’ sensation of an intensive quantity could serve as a powerful resource for grounding its formal expression, accepting the mathematical form requires students to align the sensation with a new way of reasoning about the phenomenon. I offer a case analysis of a middle school student who successfully came to understand the intensive quantity of likelihood. The analysis highlights a form of reasoning called abduction and suggests that sociocognitive processes can guide and mediate students’ abductive reasoning. Interpreting the child’s and tutor’s multimodal action through the lens of abductive inference, I demonstrate the emergence of a proportional concept as guided mediated objectification of tacit perception. This “gestalt first” process is contrasted with traditional “elements first” approaches to building proportional concepts, and I speculate on epistemic and cognitive implications of this contrast for the design and instruction of these important concepts. In particular, my approach highlights an important source of epistemic difficulty for students as they learn intensive quantities: the difficulty in shifting from intuitive perceptual conviction to mediated disciplinary analysis. My proposed conceptualization of learning can serve as an effective synthesis of traditional and reform-based mathematics instruction.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2011.633838,[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Embodied Cognition,[method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Microgenetic Method,[pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Embodied Learning,,,[subject] mathematics,,[construct] reasoning,",abduction,guided mediated learning,embodied cognition,,,design-based research,microgenetic analysis,qualitative,,,,mathematics,proportional reasoning,embodied learning,,,intensive quantities,manipulatives,discovery,",[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Embodied Cognition; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Microgenetic Method; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Embodied Learning; ; ; [subject] mathematics; ; [construct] reasoning,,
2,Learning Is Moving in New Ways: The Ecological Dynamics of Mathematics Education,Abrahamson & Sánchez-García,2016,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Whereas emerging technologies, such as touchscreen tablets, are bringing sensorimotor interaction back into mathematics learning activities, existing educational theory is not geared to inform or analyze passages from action to concept. We present case studies of tutor–student behaviors in an embodied-interaction learning environment, the Mathematical Imagery Trainer. Drawing on ecological dynamics—a blend of dynamical-systems theory and ecological psychology—we explain and demonstrate that: (a) students develop sensorimotor schemes as solutions to interaction problems; (b) each scheme is oriented on an attentional anchor—a real or imagined object, area, or other aspect or behavior of the perceptual manifold that emerges to facilitate motor-action coordination; and (c) when symbolic artifacts are introduced into the arena, they may both mediate new affordances for students' motor-action control and shift their discourse into explicit mathematical re-visualization of the environment. Symbolic artifacts are ontological hybrids evolving from things with which you act to things with which you think. Students engaged in embodied-interaction learning activities are first attracted to symbolic artifacts as prehensible environmental features optimizing their grip on the world, yet in the course of enacting the improved control routines, the artifacts become frames of reference for establishing and articulating quantitative systems known as mathematical reasoning.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2016.1143370,[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Ecological Dynamics; [theory] Embodied Cognition,[method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Ethnography; [method] multimodal analysis,[pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Embodied Learning,,[setting] classrooms,[subject] mathematics,,[construct] collaboration; [construct] coordination,",ecological dynamics,embodied cognition,complex sy STEMs theory,,,ethnography,multimodal analysis,design-based research,,,,mathematics,embodied learning,classrooms,,,movement,affordances,coordination,perception-action,",[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Ecological Dynamics; [theory] Embodied Cognition; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Ethnography; [method] multimodal analysis; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Embodied Learning; ; [setting] classrooms; [subject] mathematics; ; [construct] collaboration; [construct] coordination,,
3,Manufacturing authenticity as part of written PBL curriculum: Contrived versus spontaneous events,Adah Miller & Li,2025,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Project-based learning (PBL) centersauthenticity as a core principle, meaning that learningis personally meaningful to students, seen as neces-sary by others, and calls for disciplinary tools. However, science curriculum developed for scale is challenged to predict authentic events. Developers are unfamiliar with students, their context, and theways tools will emerge. Methods: Using Portraiture, this study traces how a third-grade Bilingual class, while enacting a prepack-aged science curriculum, appeared to experience authenticity. Portraiture allowed for thick descriptionof two episodes, highlighting authenticity in con-trived and spontaneous events. Findings: The teacher followed the curriculum asdesigned and students seemed to experience learn-ing as authentic. However, a spring snowstorm cre-ated the need for the teacher to depart from lessonsas written. When responding to the spontaneousevent, unlike events with contrived authenticity, students became part of crafting authentic tools andauthenticity to others, including nonhumans. Contribution: This study suggests that teacher exper-tise is critical for recognizing and seizing on thepotential for authenticity, such as responding tospontaneous events. We advocate, through the lensof social justice unionism, for future research toexplore how to trust and support teachers in depart-ing from pre-planned science lessons and to investi-gate the authentic learning that ensues.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2025.2557896,,[method] Case Study Research; [method] interview methods,[pedagogy] Problem-Based Learning (PBL); [pedagogy] Project-Based Learning (PjBL),,,[subject] STEM,,[construct] authenticity,",project-based learning,authenticity,,,curriculum analysis,case study,qualitative inquiry,interviews,,,,curriculum,STEM,problem-based learning,,,authenticity,contrived,spontaneous,learning tasks,",; [method] Case Study Research; [method] interview methods; [pedagogy] Problem-Based Learning (PBL); [pedagogy] Project-Based Learning (PjBL); ; ; [subject] STEM; ; [construct] authenticity,,

5,Examining the Effects of Different Multiple Representational Systems in Learning Primary Mathematics,Ainsworth et al.,2002,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Multi-representational learning environments are now commonplace in schools and homes. Research that has evaluated the effectiveness of such environments shows that learners can benefit from multiple representations once they have mastered a number of complex tasks. One of the key tasks for learning with multiple representations is successful translation between representations. In order to explore the factors that influence learners' translation between representations, this article presents 2 experiments with a multi-representational environment where the difficulty of translating between representations was manipulated. Pairs of pictorial, mathematical, or mixed pictorial and mathematical representations were used to teach children in 1 of 3 experimental conditions aspects of computational estimation. In Experiment 1, all children learned to become more accurate estimators. Children in the pictorial and the mathematical conditions improved in their ability to judge the accuracy of their estimates, but children in the mixed condition did not. Experiment 2 explored if the mixed condition's difficulties with translation were temporary by requiring additional time to be spent on the system. It was found that children in all the experimental conditions improved in their judgments of estimation accuracy. It is argued that the mixed condition's failure to improve in Experiment 1 was due to the difficulties they experienced in translating information between disparate types of representation. Their success in Experiment 2 was explained not by learning to translate between representations, but through the adoption of a single representation that contained all the necessary information. This strategy was only effective because of the way that information was distributed across representations.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1101_2,[theory] Multiple Representations Theory,[method] experimental design,,,[setting] classrooms,[subject] mathematics,,[construct] problem solving; [construct] representations,",multiple representations,cognitive science,mathematics learning,,,experimental design,computer-based,quantitative,,,,mathematics,primary education,classrooms,,,translation,functions,graphs,tables,problem solving,representations",[theory] Multiple Representations Theory; [method] experimental design; ; ; [setting] classrooms; [subject] mathematics; ; [construct] problem solving; [construct] representations,,
6,Multilevel Boundary Crossing in a Professional Development School Partnership,Akkerman & Bruining,2016,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This study aims to understand the recurrent challenges of professional development school (PDS) partnerships experienced by many countries. It does so by conceptualizing PDS partnerships as endeavors to cross institutionally and epistemologically developed boundaries between teacher education, schooling, and academic research. After introducing what we call a multilevel boundary crossing approach, we look at the startup years of one academic PDS partnership, scrutinizing the successive learning mechanisms that were evoked at the institutional, interpersonal, and intrapersonal levels. The case study narrative illustrates the multilevel nature of boundary crossing and reveals different learning mechanisms in different phases and at different levels. For example, whereas coordination initially occurred at all levels, transformation occurred in later years mainly at the intrapersonal level. The study sheds specific light on the intrapersonal level by showing the significant and challenging role of various brokers in establishing both horizontal and vertical connections across and within the organizations involved. Despite being important leaders of the partnerships’ activities, we observed how brokers prevented others from becoming more involved. We propose that partnerships should carefully consider the sort of learning processes they aspire to and can realistically expect at different levels and moments in time and accordingly consider how they want to position the various actors.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2016.1147448,[theory] Expansive Learning,[method] Case Study Research; [method] Narrative Inquiry,,,[setting] teacher education; [setting] teacher professional development,,,[construct] collaboration; [construct] coordination,",boundary crossing,professional development school,multilevel learning,,,case study,narrative inquiry,longitudinal,,,,teacher education,partnerships,professional development,,,brokers,coordination,transformation,collaboration,boundary work,",[theory] Expansive Learning; [method] Case Study Research; [method] Narrative Inquiry; ; ; [setting] teacher education; [setting] teacher professional development; ; ; [construct] collaboration; [construct] coordination,,
7,Fighting for Desired Versions of a Future Self: How Young Women Negotiated STEM-Related Identities in the Discursive Landscape of Educational Opportunity,Allen & Eisenhart,2017,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"In this article, we investigate how the national imperative to increase opportunities for young women of color in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and to broaden their participation was taken up locally at two high schools in one school district. Using ethnographic and longitudinal data, we focus on four young women of color (two at each school) as they negotiated STEM-related identities in the discursive and practice contexts of their lives at school. Using Holland and Lave’s concept of history in person, we view the young women as fighting for particular versions of a future self while entangled in discursive and social relations that threatened to position them differently than they wished to be. We find that their fight for future selves was not—for them—with the national narrative about women of color in STEM but with local school narratives that negatively positioned students of color more broadly and remained silent on issues of gender, the intersection of gender and race, and the implications for STEM. High school success in STEM came as a hopeful but potentially fragile byproduct of struggles to differentiate themselves from people like them (other Blacks, Latinas, the poor). Implications of these findings are discussed.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2017.1294985,[theory] Identity Theory,[method] Ethnography,,[population] high school; [population] young women,,[subject] STEM,,[construct] discourse; [construct] gender; [construct] negotiation,",identity theory,history-in-person,discourse,,,ethnography,longitudinal study narrative inquiry,,,,high school,STEM,young women,,,future self,negotiation,gender,race,inequity / inequality / inequality,",[theory] Identity Theory; [method] Ethnography; ; [population] high school; [population] young women; ; [subject] STEM; ; [construct] discourse; [construct] gender; [construct] negotiation,,
8,"Interaction, Comprehension, and Instruction Usage",Alterman et al.,1991,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article explores the learning of common practice in a community of agents. We focus on how learning occurs ""out in the world,"" rather than on learning as it occurs in the classroom. The emphasis of this article is that much of the learning of practice is guided by comprehension processes. We take as prima facie evidence for this the ubiquitousness of instructions.

9,Cognitive Tutors: Lessons Learned,Anderson et al.,1995,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article reviews the 10-year history of tutor development based on the advanced computer tutoring theory (J. R. Anderson, 1983, 1993). We developed production system models in ACT of how students solved problems in LISP, geometry, and algebra. Computer tutors were developed around these cognitive models. Construction of these tutors was guided by a set of eight principles loosely based on the ACT theory. Early evaluations of these tutors usually, but not always, showed significant achievement gains. Best case evaluations showed that students could achieve at least the same level of proficiency as conventional instruction in one third of the time. Empirical studies showed that students were learning skills in production-rule units and that the best tutorial interaction style was one in which the tutor provides immediate feedback, consisting of short and directed error messages. The tutors appear to work better if they present themselves to students as nonhuman tools to assist learning rather than as emulations of human tutors. Students working with these tutors display transfer to other environments to the degree that they can map the tutor environment into the test environment. These experiences have coalesced into a new system for developing and deploying tutors. This system involves selecting a problem-solving interface, constructing a curriculum under the guidance of a domain expert, designing a cognitive model for solving problems in that environment, building instruction around the productions in that model, and deploying the tutor in the classroom. New tutors are being built in this system to achieve the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) standards for high-school mathematics in an urban setting.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0402_2,[theory] ACT* Theory of Cognition; [theory] Cognitive Modeling; [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR),[method] Design-Based Research (DBR),[pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR),,,[subject] computer science / programming; [subject] mathematics,[technology] intelligent tutoring systems,[construct] feedback; [construct] transfer,",ACT* theory of cognition,cognitive tutoring sy STEMs,intelligent tutoring sy STEMs,,,empirical evaluation,production modeling,design-based research,,,,mathematics,programming,geometry,algebra,,,cognitive models,transfer,feedback,tutoring,",[theory] ACT* Theory of Cognition; [theory] Cognitive Modeling; [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); ; ; [subject] computer science / programming; [subject] mathematics; [technology] intelligent tutoring systems; [construct] feedback; [construct] transfer,,
10,Youth as pattern makers for racial justice: How speculative design pedagogy in science can promote restorative futures through radical care practices,Arada et al.,2023,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: We examine the development of youth sociopolitical consciousness and agency in an eighth-grade science classroom as students of color engage in critical speculative design activities, exploring the multi-scalar, racial realities and possibilities of the science and engineering of pervasive digital technologies—specifically involving the entanglement of lightwaves and melanin in computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.Methods Through case studies of two girls of color (ES and GS), we analyze the youths’ learning pathways across three instructional phases: threading practices (learners’ sociopolitical interpretation); weaving practices (learners’ coordination of multiple ways of knowing and being in relation to their interpretation); and patternmaking practices (learners’ visions of more just patterns, practices, and politics through speculative design).Findings Our analyses show how youth use their felt, cultural, and community knowledges, as well as their developing scientific knowledge of physics, to confront and analyze manifestations of racial bias in technologies. The findings highlight the significance of teachers’ pedagogical support and providing opportunities for meaningful transdisciplinary science investigations and speculative designing for more just and thriving futures.Contribution The Critical Speculative Design Pedagogy framework developed suggests how such activities in the classroom can cultivate equitable, expansive science learning that is consequential to youth and their communities.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2022.2154158,[theory] Critical Science Education; [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR),[method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Speculative Design Research,[pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR),[population] high school,,[subject] activism; [subject] science,,[construct] agency; [construct] equity,",speculative design,critical science education,sociocultural,,,design-based research,qualitative,,,,science education,high school,,,racial justice,youth agency,pattern making,equity,activism,",[theory] Critical Science Education; [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Speculative Design Research; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [population] high school; ; [subject] activism; [subject] science; ; [construct] agency; [construct] equity,,
11,“I’m Being a Man Here”: Urban Boys’ Performances of Masculinity and Engagement With Science During a Science Museum Visit,Archer et al.,2016,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The importance of increasing and widening participation in post-compulsory science and informal science learning (ISL) spaces is widely recognized—particularly for working-class and minority ethnic communities. While there is a growing understanding of the intersection of femininity with class, ethnicity, and science learning across formal and informal settings, there has been little work on how masculinity may shape urban boys’ science (non)participation and (dis)engagement. This article analyzes performances of masculinity enacted by 36 urban, working-class boys (from diverse ethnic backgrounds) during school science museum visits, exploring how these performances relate to science identity and engagement. We identify three main performances of masculinity enacted during the visits (“laddishness,” “muscular intellect,” and “translocational masculinity”), and trace the implications of each for boys’ science engagement. We consider the power implications of these performances, notably the extent to which hegemonic masculinity is normalized within the science museum space, the ways in which this normalization is co-constitutive of the boys’ performances of masculinity, and the implications of the boys’ performances of masculinity for other students (notably girls and less dominant boys). The article concludes with implications for research, policy, and practice regarding how to promote equitable participation and science learning within ISL.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2016.1187147,[theory] Identity Theory,,,,,[subject] science,,[construct] engagement; [construct] identity; [construct] performance,"Identity Theory, Critical Masculinity Studies, Sociocultural Learning Theory,ethnographic study, video-based discourse analysis,Informal Science Learning, Identity-Based Learning,science education, museum field trip,identity, masculinity, engagement, performance, positioning",[theory] Identity Theory; ; ; ; ; [subject] science; ; [construct] engagement; [construct] identity; [construct] performance,,
12,Learning that physics is ‘not for me’: Pedagogic work and the cultivation of habitus among advanced level physics students,Archer et al.,2020,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: There is widespread agreement that participation in post-compulsory physics needs to be widened and increased, particularly among women and under-represented communities. This paper contributes to understanding of the processes that produce unequal participation, Methods: The paper undertakes a Bourdieusian analysis of longitudinal interview data from 75 interviews conducted with fifteen students, tracked from age 10-18, who studied Advanced level physics in England. Findings: The paper discusses evidence of a physics habitus that was strongly aligned with notions of intelligence/cleverness and masculinity and identifies how young women were particularly disadvantaged by a popular notion of the “effortlessly clever physicist”, which encouraged even highly interested and high attaining young women not to continue further with the subject. We identified three main forms of pedagogic work performed by school physics (attainment-based practices of debarring and gatekeeping; curriculum practices of deferring ‘real’ physics and physics ‘lies’; and interpersonal reinforcement of doxa), which helped cultivate student habitus over time and produce inequitable patterns of participation Contribution: Analyses show that school physics contributes to reproducing inequitable (and low overall) patterns of participation.

13,Novice Diagnostic Reasoning in Medicine: Accounting for Evidence,Arocha & Patel,1995,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This study investigated the strategies used by beginning, intermediate, and advanced medical students when solving clinical cases containing inconsistent data. Written clinical cases were used in which the initial patient data suggested a very common and prototypical disease. Subsequent data in the cases were inconsistent with this first suggestion. The cases were presented on a computer so that the subjects had the opportunity to reason aloud about the evidence. Verbal protocols were collected and analyzed. Our results showed that the beginning students generated the suggested hypothesis and either ignored or reinterpreted the inconsistent evidence to fit their initial hypotheses. Advanced novices generated several hypotheses with a similar underlying problem; this allowed them to narrow their initial hypothesis set in the face of inconsistent evidence and make fewer data reinterpretations. Intermediate novices showed a similar pattern but failed to change their hypotheses with inconsistent data. They maintained several hypotheses of a diverse nature concurrently, without evaluating them efficiently. They showed a deterioration in performance—commonly known as the intermediate effect—which we interpreted as the result of a process of knowledge reorganization that interferes with problem solving. Results are discussed in terms of change in reasoning strategies as a function of the type of learning in medical school.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0404_1,,[method] protocol analysis; [method] think-aloud protocols,[pedagogy] Case-Based Learning (CBL); [pedagogy] Case-Based Reasoning; [pedagogy] Metacognitive Strategy Instruction; [theory] Case-Based Instruction; [theory] Case-Based Reasoning,[population] novices; [population] physicians,,,,[construct] evidence,",diagnostic reasoning frameworks,hypothesis-evidence coordination,,,think-aloud,verbal protocol analysis,case-based reasoning,,,medicine,novices,physicians,clinical cases,,evidence,medical training,reasoning,intermediate effect,",; [method] protocol analysis; [method] think-aloud protocols; [pedagogy] Case-Based Learning (CBL); [pedagogy] Case-Based Reasoning; [pedagogy] Metacognitive Strategy Instruction; [theory] Case-Based Instruction; [theory] Case-Based Reasoning; [population] novices; [population] physicians; ; ; ; [construct] evidence,,
14,Constructing shared understanding of complex interdisciplinary problems: Epistemic games in interdisciplinary teamwork,Arthars et al.,2024,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Constructing shared understanding of complex interdisciplinary problems is one of the most challenging aspects of interdisciplinary teamwork. How this process unfolds is under-researched, making it esoteric and difficult to scaffold. This paper aims to provide an articulated and nuanced account of what is involved in student teams’ construction of shared understanding of complex interdisciplinary problems.Methods: The study combines the theoretical lens of epistemic games with an ecological analytical perspective. Drawing on the analysis of ethnographic cases, it explores how four graduate student teams construct shared understanding of complex problems during interdisciplinary projects. Findings: Construction of shared understanding is a multifaceted and dynamic process that extends over the entire problem-solving activity. It relies on epistemic moves that explicate and juxtapose different perspectives and connect abstract ideas with knowledge grounded in students’ experiences and contexts. The pursuits students engage in, when creating shared understanding, reveal epistemic differences related to formulation of the interdisciplinary problem and what constitutes trustworthy knowledge.Contribution: The paper contributes to the literature on the nature of students’ construction of shared understanding of complex interdisciplinary problems revealing critical recurrent moves.

The aim was to shed light on the I-Position and multivoicedness in students' identity building and to provide empirical substantiation for these theoretical constructs, focusing especially on the connection between personal knowledge and theoretical knowledge. The study explored how health science students' reflections on their work and discipline-related experiences provided resources for making personal sense of and understanding the subject studied. The students took an online course on the philosophy of science. To study students' internal and external dialogue in terms of multi voicedness in their sense-making processes I combined a discourse analysis with a dialogical approach. The results showed that in reflecting on their experiences in light of different scientific approaches, the students became engaged in dialogues with different voices, thereby experiencing tensions in their professional positioning. The reasoning tasks gave rise to internal dialogue, involving negotiation between different I-Positions of the self or heterodialogue with the texts. These identity negotiations were manifested in refining, strengthening, and reconstructing professional and scientific I-Positions and in sharing and constructing a We-Position.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2014.941465,[theory] Dialogism / Bakhtinian Theory,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA),,,[setting] higher education,[subject] health sciences,,[construct] agency; [construct] identity,",dialogical self,i-positions,multivoicedness,,,discourse analysis,qualitative,,,,higher education,health sciences,online,,,identity,professional agency,internal dialogue,multivoicedness,",[theory] Dialogism / Bakhtinian Theory; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); ; ; [setting] higher education; [subject] health sciences; ; [construct] agency; [construct] identity,,
16,The Construction of Knowledge in Classroom Talk,Atwood et al.,2010,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Social interaction is important for the development of knowledge (M. Chapman, 1991). Social interaction, however, takes many forms, and J. Piaget (1977/1995) proposed that the construction of knowledge is facilitated in cooperative as opposed to constraining relationships. These views of knowledge development were drawn on in a study of classroom talk in higher education, namely in 2 first- and 2 fourth-year college and university psychology classes. Classroom talk was recorded, transcribed, and analyzed following conversation analytic (H. Sacks, 1992) and social pragmatic (W. Turnbull, 2003) approaches. Examination of how cooperation and constraint were constituted in the corpus was based on N. Mercer's (1995, 2000) categorization of different ways of making reasoning manifest, namely exploratory talk, or the joint negotiation of ideas; disputational talk, or the competitive negotiation of knowledge claims; and cumulative talk, or the uncritical addition of knowledge claims. Analysis focused on the sequential structures of classroom talk in and through which reasoning is achieved. Analysis revealed that most fourth-year talk was exploratory, whereas most first-year talk was disputational or cumulative.

18,The Tailored Practice of Hobbies and Its Implication for the Design of Interest-Driven Learning Environments,Azevedo,2013,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article seeks to sharpen current conceptualizations of interests and engaged participation, and to derive lessons for the design of interest-driven science learning environments (formal and informal). The empirical basis of the research is a set of ethnographic records of two communities of amateur astronomers, as well as the details of astronomers’ instantiations of the hobby. Hobbies are paradigmatic examples of interest-driven practices and thus they offer an excellent window into truly interest-related phenomena and processes. The analysis and data collection followed a grounded theoretical process, which I describe in two parts. First, I comb through the data iteratively and present a theory of persistent engagement in a hobby practice. Based on this theoretical sketch, I then explain how individuals’ persistent, interest-based pursuit of amateur astronomy is made possible by 4 structural and process features of the practice, which together afford individuals the ability to continuously tailor the hobby: (a) an extensive and varied material infrastructure; (b) participating simultaneously across multiple communities/sites of astronomy practice; (c) activity structural resources that function as templates for short- and long-term activities; and (d) processes of collaboration and idea sharing. Lessons for the design of science learning environments that are truly interest-driven follow.

19,Seeing in the Dark: Embodied Cognition in Amateur Astronomy Practice,Azevedo & Mann,2017,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"We add to research on embodied cognition by investigating the observational practices of amateur astronomers. Specifically, we take an interactionist perspective and examine how the body is recruited, moment by moment, as a resource for producing and communicating meaning during field activity. The data corpus is a set of ethnographic video records and field notes on the routines of a community of astronomers, especially small-group interactions during planning, searching for, observing, and confirming sight of a celestial target. Within this space, our analysis highlights how different modalities of embodied action and reasoning (gestures, tool use, gaze, touch, and others) were deployed and coordinated throughout the process of observing a celestial object and how those emerged in the transactions among participants. Our findings rehearse many issues and topics in the contemporary literature (e.g., gesturing for measuring or representationally) but also reveal important, novel forms of embodied action and reasoning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics practices (e.g., training the eyes in averted vision and inscribing a celestial scene onto one’s hand). More broadly, these findings further affirm the power of interactionist analyses of knowing and learning while also surfacing areas in which expanded theorizing is needed to account for the full set of cognitive phenomena we observed.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2017.1336439,[theory] Distributed Cognition; [theory] Embodied Cognition,[method] Ethnography; [method] participant observation,,,[setting] informal learning,,,[construct] distributed cognition; [construct] observation,",embodied cognition,distributed cognition,,,ethnography,observation,qualitative,,,,astronomy,informal learning,hobbies,,,telescopes,star parties,tool use,sensory experience,",[theory] Distributed Cognition; [theory] Embodied Cognition; [method] Ethnography; [method] participant observation; ; ; [setting] informal learning; ; ; [construct] distributed cognition; [construct] observation,,
20,"The Use of Immersive Virtual Reality in the Learning Sciences: Digital Transformations of Teachers, Students, and Social Context",Bailenson et al.,2008,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article illustrates the utility of using virtual environments to transform social interaction via behavior and context, with the goal of improving learning in digital environments. We first describe the technology and theories behind virtual environments and then report data from 4 empirical studies. In Experiment 1, we demonstrated that teachers with augmented social perception (i.e., receiving visual warnings alerting them to students not receiving enough teacher eye gaze) were able to spread their attention more equally among students than teachers without augmented perception. In Experiments 2 and 3, we demonstrated that by breaking the rules of spatial proximity that exist in physical space, students can learn more by being in the center of the teacher's field of view (compared to the periphery) and by being closer to the teacher (compared to farther away). In Experiment 4, we demonstrated that inserting virtual co-learners who were either model students or distracting students changed the learning abilities of experiment participants who conformed to the virtual co-learners. Results suggest that virtual environments will have a unique ability to alter the social dynamics of learning environments via transformed social interaction.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508400701793141,[theory] Embodied Knowing / Embodiment,[method] experimental design,[pedagogy] Simulation-Based Learning,,,[subject] psychology education,[technology] computer-mediated learning; [technology] simulations,[construct] feedback; [construct] interaction,"Virtual Reality Theory, Transformed Social Interaction (TSI), Social Presence Theory,experimental design, controlled laboratory study,Simulation-Based Learning, Computer-Mediated Learning,psychology education, virtual environments, immersive virtual reality,presence, attention, feedback, embodiment, social interaction",[theory] Embodied Knowing / Embodiment; [method] experimental design; [pedagogy] Simulation-Based Learning; ; ; [subject] psychology education; [technology] computer-mediated learning; [technology] simulations; [construct] feedback; [construct] interaction,,

Moment-by-moment learning is calculated using a data-mined model that assesses the probability that a student learned a skill or concept at a specific time during learning (CitationBaker, Goldstein, & Heffernan, 2010, 2011). Two coders labeled data from students who used an intelligent tutoring system for college genetics. They coded in terms of 7 forms that the moment-by-moment learning curve can take. These labels are correlated to test data on the robustness of students’ learning. We find that different visual forms are correlated with very different learning outcomes. This work suggests that analysis of moment-by-moment learning curves may be able to shed light on the implications of students’ different patterns of learning over time.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2013.836653,[theory] Cognitive-Affective Learning Theory; [theory] Learning Analytics,[method] data mining; [method] Time-Series Analysis,,,[setting] digital learning environments,,[technology] artificial intelligence; [technology] computer-based instruction; [technology] data science,[construct] affect; [construct] engagement,"Learning Analytics Framework, Educational Data Mining (EDM), Cognitive-Affective Learning Theory,data mining, time-series analysis, machine learning,Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS),computer-based learning, digital learning environments,learning curves, engagement, affect, performance prediction, robust learning",[theory] Cognitive-Affective Learning Theory; [theory] Learning Analytics; [method] data mining; [method] Time-Series Analysis; ; ; [setting] digital learning environments; ; [technology] artificial intelligence; [technology] computer-based instruction; [technology] data science; [construct] affect; [construct] engagement,,

The members of the collaboration team implemented these reforms with the goal of supporting all students’ learning of 1st-year college preparatory mathematics. This study used conceptual tools from frame analysis (E. Goffman, 1974) alongside an analysis of teacher participation patterns to understand teacher learning within a community of practice (E. Wenger, 1998). This analysis documented development within the teacher community through teachers increasing orientation to classroom-based interventions for struggling students alongside more collegial participation patterns, contributing an empirical example of teacher learning within a community of practice.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2014.999196,,[method] Case Study Research; [method] Ethnography; [method] frame analysis,,[population] high school; [population] teachers,,,,,"[theory] Communities of Practice,case study, ethnography, frame analysis,,[population] professional development participants, [population] teachers, [population] high school, math,[construct] discussion, [construct] participation",; [method] Case Study Research; [method] Ethnography; [method] frame analysis; ; [population] high school; [population] teachers; ; ; ; ,,
23,Principles of Self-Organization: Learning as Participation in Autocatakinetic Systems,Barab et al.,1999,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Modern science has been built on a Cartesian or Newtonian (mechanical) world view giving rise to an artifactual view of mind and suggesting that particles (learners) are continuously working to destroy order (are recalcitrant), which can only be maintained by an external artificer (the teacher). At the core of the Cartesian worldview is the absolute separation of mind and matter. Beginning with the separation of mind and body, Cartesianism is grounded in a set of dualisms that separate individual from environment and leads to the belief that knowledge refers to a self-sufficient immaterial substance that can be understood independently from the individual, environment, and context in which it is situated. In contrast, we make the argument for an alternative set of assumptions predicated on a relational ontology and grounded in recent developments in the understanding of self-organizing systems. In our view, knowing, meaning, and cognition are actualized through the dynamic between learner (self) and environment (nonself), and that which is neither the learner nor the environment. We further argue that the ecologized, or self-organization, model (relational ontology) establishes that (under the appropriate conditions) the particles (learners), in effect, ""want"" to or strive opportunistically to order themselves once the intention has been properly initialized. From this perspective, instruction involves establishing the appropriate field conditions or connecting the learner into a system (a set of relations) through participation (e.g., as part of a community of practice) in the service of an intention. The type of learning that we are advocating cannot be handed to the learner wholecloth but develops itself through dynamic activity (participation) as part of a system as a whole. Central to this line of reasoning is the assertion not only that learner practices and meaningful relations that arise due to their functional significance as part of a dynamic system are fundamentally different from teacher- or text-book-owned descriptions of practices and meanings, but that they are in this way far richer, more meaningful, and more functional. Context and participation, to put it directly, not only matter but in a deep and fundamental way are everything.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.1999.9672074,[theory] Communities of Practice; [theory] Dynamic Systems Theory; [theory] Ecological Perspective,[method] conceptual modeling; [method] Ecological Perspective,[pedagogy] Communities of Practice,,,,,[construct] participation,",self-organization theory,relational ontology,ecological perspective,communities of practice,,,theoretical analysis,conceptual,,,,dynamic sy STEMs,education research,,,autocatakinetic,participation,context,",[theory] Communities of Practice; [theory] Dynamic Systems Theory; [theory] Ecological Perspective; [method] conceptual modeling; [method] Ecological Perspective; [pedagogy] Communities of Practice; ; ; ; ; [construct] participation,,
24,Constructing Networks of Action-Relevant Episodes: An In Situ Research Methodology,Barab et al.,1999,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"In this article, we advance a methodology for capturing and tracing the emergence, evolution, and diffusion of a practice, conceptual understanding, resource, or student-constructed artifact. The Constructing Networks of Action-Relevant Episodes (CN-ARE) methodology allows researchers to identify relevant data from a complex, evolving environment, and then to organize it into a web of action that can illuminate the historical development (evolving trajectory) of the phenomenon of interest (e.g., conception of an eclipse, applications of a mathematical formula, an evolving student-constructed Website). To accomplish this end, experiences are (a) sectioned into action-relevant episodes (AREs), (b) parsed down to codes in a database, and (c) then represented as nodes in a network so that the historical development of the particular phenomenon of interest can be traced. The CN-ARE methodology is especially useful for researchers interested in carrying out design experiments in which research findings with respect to one iteration of a course are cycled into the design of future course instantiations. In addition to setting the context and providing a theoretical rationale for the CN-ARE methodology, this discussion includes an in-depth description of the methodology along with its application to data sets. Following these examples, we close with a discussion of the scope and limitations of this methodology, touching on issues of trustworthiness, credibility, and usefulness.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS10-1-2_5,[theory] Actor-Network Theory (ANT); [theory] Distributed Cognition; [theory] Situated Cognition; [theory] Situative Perspective,[method] Design-Based Research (DBR),,,,,,[construct] distributed cognition,",situated cognition,distributed cognition,actor-network,situative perspective,,,in-situ research,design research,activity tracing,,,,learning in classrooms and mediated environments,,,in-situ,practices,networks,distributed knowledge,",[theory] Actor-Network Theory (ANT); [theory] Distributed Cognition; [theory] Situated Cognition; [theory] Situative Perspective; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); ; ; ; ; ; [construct] distributed cognition,,

26,Developing an Empirical Account of a Community of Practice: Characterizing the Essential Tensions,Barab et al.,2002,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article examines the potential of a learning-as-a-part-of-a-community approach, focusing on the participatory process of learning in a community-based, teacher education program; a Community of Teachers (CoT). CoT is a preparation program for preservice teachers working toward secondary teacher certification in which they join an on-going community and remain a part of that community from 2 to 4 years. The entire process of learning as a member of CoT occurs fluidly through the reflexive relations among secondary school participation and university seminar participation, as well as through the active and reflective practices requisite for building one's portfolio of Program Expectations. In this study, 4 participant-observers used field notes, document analysis, and interview data to build grounded interpretations of community life. In this reporting of the data, we have framed these ""experience-near"" understandings in terms of core tensions (or illuminative dualities) and presented them in a manner that is likely to have ""experience-distant"" significance. By characterizing CoT life in terms of tensions or dualities, we hope to provide other educators-designers with an illuminative case study from which they can build petite generalizations-that is, use this discussion to more readily identify patterns occurring in their own interventions and navigate the challenges they face more intelligently.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1104_3,[theory] Communities of Practice; [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Situated Learning; [theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Ethnography; [method] longitudinal study,[pedagogy] Communities of Practice; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR),,[setting] teacher education,,,[construct] collaboration; [construct] identity; [construct] participation; [construct] tension,",communities of practice,sociocultural theory,situated learning,,,ethnographic analysis,design-based research,longitudinal study,,,,teacher education,professional learning communities,,,participation,identity,tension,practice-based learning,collaboration,",[theory] Communities of Practice; [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Situated Learning; [theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Ethnography; [method] longitudinal study; [pedagogy] Communities of Practice; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); ; [setting] teacher education; ; ; [construct] collaboration; [construct] identity; [construct] participation; [construct] tension,,
28,Our Designs and the Social Agendas They Carry,Barab et al.,2007,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Although the work of learning scientists and instructional designers has brought about countless curricula, designs, and theoretical claims, the community has been less active in communicating the explicit and implicit critical social agendas that result (or could result) from their work. It is our belief that the community of learning scientists is well positioned to build transformative models of what could be, to develop learning and teaching interventions that have impact, and to advance theory that will prove valuable to others. This potential, we argue, would be significantly heightened if we as a community embrace the critical agendas that are central to so many discussions in anthropology, philosophy, or even curriculum development more generally. Instead of simply building an artifact to help individuals accomplish a particular task, or to meet a specific standard, the focus of critical design work is to develop sociotechnical structures that facilitate individuals in critiquing and improving themselves and the societies in which they function, and then we use our understanding of participation with these structures to advance theory.

29,Lessening the Load of Misconceptions: Design-Based Principles for Algebra Learning,Barbieri et al.,2019,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The current study examined the effectiveness of self-explanation prompts, visual signaling cues, and a combination of the two features on middle school students’ (N = 202) algebra learning. Also explored were the differential effects of features for students with faulty conceptual knowledge (evidenced by a higher prevalence of making errors during problem solving) on learning. That is, we assessed whether students who make prevalent conceptual errors predictive of algebra performance differentially benefit from design features. Participants were randomly assigned to complete 1 of 4 sets of worked example assignments supplemented with self-explanation prompts (n = 51), visual signaling cues (n = 49), both features (n = 51), or neither feature (n = 51). Worked examples supplemented with either self-explanation prompts or signaling cues led to greater learning from pre- to posttest in comparison to the worked example control, with practically meaningful effects. The effect of assignments supplemented with signaling cues was moderated by error prevalence. Those who made errors more frequently demonstrating misunderstanding of algebraic concepts (e.g., the meaning of a coefficient) benefited significantly more from visual signaling cues alone than self-explanation prompts alone or control assignments. These findings highlight the importance of considering differential effects of design features when used in combination or in isolation, particularly for struggling students.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2019.1573428,[theory] Cognitive Load Theory; [theory] Conceptual Change Theory; [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR),[method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] experimental design,[pedagogy] Cognitive Load Theory; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Self-Explanation,,,[subject] mathematics,,,"Design-Based Research, Cognitive Load Theory, Conceptual Change Theory,experimental design, learning intervention study,Worked Example Instruction, Self-Explanation Prompting,mathematics education, middle school classrooms,misconceptions, algebra, conceptual knowledge, self-explanation, signaling",[theory] Cognitive Load Theory; [theory] Conceptual Change Theory; [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] experimental design; [pedagogy] Cognitive Load Theory; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Self-Explanation; ; ; [subject] mathematics; ; ,,
30,Achieving Coordination in Collaborative Problem-Solving Groups,Barron,2000,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"In this article, interactive processes among group partners and the relationship of these processes to problem-solving outcomes are investigated in 2 contrasting groups. The case study groups were selected for robust differences in the quality of their written solutions to a problem and parallel differences in the quality of the group members' interaction. In 1 group correct proposals were generated, confirmed, documented, and reflected upon. In the other, they were generated, rejected without rationale, and for the most part left undocumented. The analyses identified 3 major contrastive dimensions in group interaction-the mutuality of exchanges, the achievement of joint attentional engagement, and the alignment of group members' goals for the problem solving process. A focus on group-level characteristics offers a distinctive strategy for examining small group learning and paves the way to understanding reasons for variability of outcomes in collaborative ventures. These dimensions may usefully inform the design and assessment of collaborative learning environments.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS0904_2,[theory] Distributed Cognition,[method] Interaction / Video Analysis,,,[setting] classrooms,,,[construct] collaboration; [construct] coordination; [construct] participation,",sociocultural,coordination framework,,,micro-analysis,video analysis,,,,small groups,classrooms,,,coordination,participation,collaboration,",[theory] Distributed Cognition; [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; ; ; [setting] classrooms; ; ; [construct] collaboration; [construct] coordination; [construct] participation,,
31,When Smart Groups Fail,Barron,2003,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"In this study I investigated how collaborative interactions influence problem-solving outcomes. Conversations of twelve 6th-grade triads were analyzed utilizing quantitative and qualitative methods. Neither prior achievement of group members nor the generation of correct ideas for solution could account for between-triad differences in problem-solving outcomes. Instead, both characteristics of proposals and partner responsiveness were important correlates of the uptake and documentation of correct ideas by the group. Less successful groups ignored or rejected correct proposals, whereas more successful groups discussed or accepted them. Conversations in less successful groups were relatively incoherent as measured by the extent that proposals for solutions in these groups were connected with preceding discussions. Performance differences observed in triads extended to subsequent problem-solving sessions during which all students solved the same kinds of problems independently. These findings suggest that the quality of interaction had implications for learning. Case study descriptions illustrate the interweaving of social and cognitive factors involved in establishing a joint problem-solving space. A dual-space model of what collaboration requires of participants is described to clarify how the content of the problem and the relational context are interdependent aspects of the collaborative situation. How participants manage these interacting spaces is critical to the outcome of their work and helps account for variability in collaborative outcomes. Directions for future research that may help teachers, students, and designers of educational environments learn to see and foster productive interactional practices are proposed.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1203_1,[theory] (Cultural-Historical) Activity Theory (CHAT); [theory] Distributed Cognition; [theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] coding and categorization; [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [method] qualitative coding,[pedagogy] Collaborative Learning,,,[subject] science,,[construct] collaboration; [construct] communication; [construct] coordination; [construct] distributed cognition; [construct] participation,"Distributed Cognition, Sociocultural Theory, Activity Theory,case study research, video analysis, qualitative coding,Collaborative Learning,middle school classrooms, science,collaboration, reasoning, participation, coordination, communication",[theory] (Cultural-Historical) Activity Theory (CHAT); [theory] Distributed Cognition; [theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] coding and categorization; [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [method] qualitative coding; [pedagogy] Collaborative Learning; ; ; [subject] science; ; [construct] collaboration; [construct] communication; [construct] coordination; [construct] distributed cognition; [construct] participation,,

Our 1st aim is to problematize some current assumptions about the goals of epistemic education and to argue that existing models of lay or expert epistemologies cannot directly translate into educational goals. Our 2nd aim is to present a fresh integrative analysis of the goals of epistemic education based on both philosophical arguments and empirical research. Synthesizing these sources, we propose that the overarching purpose of epistemic education is to promote learners’ apt epistemic performance, defined as performance that achieves valuable epistemic aims through competence. We identify 5 key aspects of epistemic performance that are important to achieving this goal: engaging in reliable cognitive processes that lead to the achievement of epistemic aims, adapting epistemic performance to diverse situations, metacognitively regulating and understanding epistemic performance, caring about and enjoying epistemic performance, and participating in epistemic performance together with others. Each of these aspects involves competent engagement with epistemic aims and value, epistemic ideals, and reliable epistemic processes.

34,Motivation and Transfer: The Role of Mastery-Approach Goals in Preparation for Future Learning,Belenky & Nokes-Malach,2012,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The study of knowledge transfer rarely draws upon motivational constructs in empirical work. We investigated how students' achievement goals interact with different forms of instruction to promote transfer, defined as preparation for future learning (CitationBransford & Schwartz, 1999) Students were given either invention or tell-and-practice activities when learning statistics concepts and their achievement goal orientations were measured at the beginning of the experiment. We also assessed students' goals during the learning activity. We predicted that students who entered the experiment with a high mastery-approach goal orientation would be more likely to transfer, regardless of instruction. We also hypothesized that invention activities would lead to higher mastery-approach goal adoption for the task and more attention to important conceptual features, as students would focus on trying to understand the material. Finally, because we expected that invention activities would promote mastery goal adoption during the task, we predicted a moderating effect of invention activities, such that there would be a smaller effect for students' initial mastery-approach goal orientation on transfer for those who invented compared to those who received tell-and-practice instruction. All three hypotheses were supported.

Sickle Cell Counselor, a computer program designed to teach museum visitors about sickle cell disease by placing them in the role of a genetic counselor, is the first step in our development of GBSs. While using Sickle Cell Counselor, a museum visitor advises couples about the difficult decision of whether or not to have children when there is a substantial genetic risk of the disease. To carry out this task, the visitor can perform simulated laboratory tests and ask questions of several experts via interactive video.

36,Investigate and Decide Learning Environments: Specializing Task Models for Authoring Tool Design,Bell,1998,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The complexities of building educational software can be reduced by relying on appropriate tools for adapting and re-using similar, previous applications. Although researchers have been creating tools for automating some aspects of software design, most of these tools typically aim for generality, attempting to cover a broad class of interactive programs in many domains. However, this approach may not be effective for building complex interactive systems, and fails to re-apply the instruction and design expertise implicit within prior software applications. An alternative is to provide tools which use specialized, rather than general, task models, tailored specifically to a target category of software.

37,Special Issue: Designing Learning Environments for Equitable Disciplinary Identification,Bell et al.,2017,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This special issue is focused on investigating the role of learners’ self-identification with disciplinary endeavors (e.g., science-related investigations, interpretations of historical events) in relation to the design of and their participation in learning environments. Over the past decade there has been a growing body of research focused on how learners’ ideas about themselves as social actors in activities mediate participation within and across learning environments and how the development of learners’ disciplinary identities can be a productive goal of educational interventions. In this work, the disciplinary identities of learners help explain how and why individuals engage within and across the learning environments they frequent. They also provide a window onto how learners and their compatriots locate and leverage resources for the ongoing pursuit of subject matter learning—in which youth attempt to engage in ongoing learning. It is important to note that this theoretical lens highlights how learning environments always have implicit or explicit goals with respect to disciplinary identification—and how learners take up, resist, transform, or are marginalized by those goals.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2017.1336021,,,,,,,,[construct] equity,",disciplinary identity,sociocultural,,,synthesis,conceptual,,,,cross-disciplinary learning environments,equity-focused designs,,,identification,equity,learning sciences,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; [construct] equity,,

We draw on commognition to suggest a unified definition of dialogic mathematics peer learning as a peer interaction including two features: (a) a shift from familiar ways and rules of doing mathematics to newer, more developed ones; (b) openness to and critical engagement with each other’s suggestions that involves reliance on the more developed rules. Method: We empirically demonstrate the affordances of the suggested lens by micro-analyzing five dyadic interactions of middle-school students working on a geometric task designed to encourage a shift from familiar visual/configural ways of doing geometry to more developed deductive ones. Findings: Only one out of the five interactions included both features of dialogic mathematics peer learning; three interactions lacked both features; and one interaction included the openness and critical engagement feature but still not the mathematical shift feature. Contribution: The paper provides discursive conceptual and methodological tools for examining the intersection between two important strands of the learning sciences—mathematics learning and dialogic learning—as well as empirical and practical conclusions that foreground the complexity and fragility of this intersection.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2024.2432677,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,

40,Principled Practical Knowledge: Not a Bridge but a Ladder,Bereiter,2013,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The much-lamented gap between theory and practice in education cannot be filled by practical knowledge alone or by explanatory knowledge alone. Principled practical knowledge (PPK) is a type of knowledge that has characteristics of both practical know-how and scientific theory. Like basic scientific theory, PPK meets standards of explanatory coherence. However, its main function is not explanation or prediction but practical guidance. PPK grows out of efforts to solve practical problems, but it requires additional effort invested in producing knowledge that goes beyond what is required for the task at hand yet not so far beyond as to be unusable by practitioners. The Wright brothers’ construction of PPK to address problems of flight control is used as a model for building such knowledge in the learning sciences. Design-based research in the learning sciences may motivate research into basic theoretical questions, but it is unlikely to contribute directly to answering them. Extending design-based research to the creation of PPK can, however, increase the generalizability of knowledge produced through design work and provide a ladder leading to sometimes radical design improvement.

In this paper, I explore 1 challenge associated with this goal by examining how existing classroom practices influence students' engagement in the practice of scientific argumentation. To do so, I present discourse data from 2 middle school classes engaged in argumentation activities. For each class, I compare existing classroom practices to a discussion designed to facilitate argumentation. My analysis reveals that the existing classroom practices influenced the way in which students responded to the disparate ideas being discussed and that the immediate learning environment influenced the frequency with which students justified their ideas and directly responded to one another. This study suggests that the goal structures that aligned with the existing classroom practices carried over to students' argumentative interactions, influencing how they responded to the disparate ideas. However, the immediate learning environment—including activity structure, software tools, and teaching strategies—seemed to foster student-to-student interactions and justification of ideas.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2011.591718,[theory] Argumentation Theory; [theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] Case Study Research; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA),[pedagogy] Communities of Practice,[population] middle school,[setting] classrooms,[subject] science,,[construct] argumentation; [construct] collaboration; [construct] participation,",scientific argumentation,classroom communities,sociocultural theory,,,discourse analysis,case study,,,,middle school,science education,,,argumentation,collaboration,participation,classroom,",[theory] Argumentation Theory; [theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] Case Study Research; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [pedagogy] Communities of Practice; [population] middle school; [setting] classrooms; [subject] science; ; [construct] argumentation; [construct] collaboration; [construct] participation,,

45,Searching for Signs of Intelligent Life: An Investigation of Young Children's Beliefs About Robot Intelligence,Bernstein & Crowley,2008,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Children's worlds are increasingly populated by intelligent technologies. This has raised a number of questions about the ways in which technology can change children's ideas about important concepts, like what it means to be alive or smart. In this study, we examined the impact of experience with intelligent technologies on children's ideas about robot intelligence. A total of 60 children aged 4 through 7 were asked to identify the intellectual, psychological, and biological characteristics of 8 entities that differed in terms of their life status and intellectual capabilities. Results indicated that as children gained experience in this domain, they began to differentiate robots from other familiar entities. This differentiation was indicated by a unique pattern of responses about the intellectual and psychological characteristics of robots. These findings suggest that experience may yield a more highly developed viewpoint that reflects an appreciation of the distinctions between biological life, machines, and artificially intelligent technologies. People who grew up in the world of the mechanical are more comfortable with a definition of what is alive that excludes all but the biological and resist shifting definitions of aliveness.… Children who have grown up with computational objects don't experience that dichotomy. They turn the dichotomy into a menu and cycle through its choices.

Very few investigations have taken into consideration younger students, and none have related children's ideas about the origin of species to formal instruction on this topic. To help fill this gap, the present study examines the effect of this instruction in elementary school children by comparing Italian second graders (n = 21; age = 7 years, 1 month, to 8 years, 7 months) with third graders (n = 18; age = 8 years, 1 month, to 9 years, 4 months) who had been taught about “the earth before humans” for several months in keeping with the Italian National Syllabus for this grade level. Semistructured interviews were used to examine children's thoughts about speciation. The majority of second graders used a creationist framework, whereas most third graders used a mixed framework (referring to both creation and evolution) or an evolutionary framework. However, children did not know about the mechanism of evolution and considered it to be the result of the passage of time, the use and disuse of body parts, or the need to adapt to a changing environment, as suggested by their teacher and textbooks.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2010.508027,[theory] Evolutionary Theory,[method] interview methods; [method] surveys,,[population] elementary education; [population] middle school,,[subject] biology,,[construct] conceptual understanding,",conceptual change,evolutionary theory,,,interviews,surveys,cross-sectional,,,,elementary education,middle school,biology,,,species,origin,evolution,conceptions,",[theory] Evolutionary Theory; [method] interview methods; [method] surveys; ; [population] elementary education; [population] middle school; ; [subject] biology; ; [construct] conceptual understanding,,

Despite these challenges, few studies have characterized the knowledge, beliefs, and instructional practices that support or hinder teachers from engaging their students in building explanations. To address this gap, this study describes the understandings, purposes, goals, practices, and struggles of one third-year elementary teacher with regard to fostering students' explanation construction. Analyses showed that the teacher had multiple understandings of scientific explanations, believed that fostering students' explanations was important for both teachers and students, and enacted instructional practices that provided opportunities for students to develop explanations. However, she did not consistently take up explanation as a goal in her practice, in part because she did not see explanation construction as a strategy for facilitating the development of students' content knowledge or as an educational goal in its own right. These findings inform the field's understanding of teacher knowledge and practice with regard to one crucial scientific practice and have implications for research on teachers and inquiry-oriented science teaching, science teacher education, and curriculum materials development.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400802222917,[theory] Argumentation Theory,[method] Case Study Research,,[population] elementary education,[setting] teacher education,[subject] science,,[construct] argumentation; [construct] evidence; [construct] explanation,",science as explanation,argumentation,,,case study,practice analysis,,,,elementary education,science education,,,explanations,inquiry,evidence,teacher education,",[theory] Argumentation Theory; [method] Case Study Research; ; [population] elementary education; [setting] teacher education; [subject] science; ; [construct] argumentation; [construct] evidence; [construct] explanation,,

Generic teleological mechanisms (GTMs) are a class of strategic concepts especially useful in adaptive design. GTMs, such as cascading, feedback, and feedforward, are abstract functional and causal patterns that lead to adaptation strategies for innovative design. We adopt a task-directed approach to learning and describe a model-based method for learning GTMs from design examples. Given a design that contains a pattern previously unknown to the designer and a similar and related design that does not, the method abstracts, indexes, and stores the partern for potential reuse. Pattern abstraction is enabled by structure-behavior-function models that represent functional, causal, topological, and compositional knowledge of device designs.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0604_2,[theory] Cognitive Task Analysis,[method] Cognitive Task Analysis; [method] computational modeling; [method] design adaptation; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR),[pedagogy] Adaptive Design; [pedagogy] Case-Based Learning (CBL); [pedagogy] Case-Based Reasoning; [theory] Case-Based Instruction; [theory] Case-Based Reasoning,,,,[technology] computational modeling; [technology] simulations,[construct] problem solving,",case-based reasoning,design cognition,adaptive design,,,computational modeling,simulation,cognitive task analysis,,,,engineering design,AI-based learning environments,,,innovative strategies,analogical reasoning,design mechanisms,problem solving,",[theory] Cognitive Task Analysis; [method] Cognitive Task Analysis; [method] computational modeling; [method] design adaptation; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Adaptive Design; [pedagogy] Case-Based Learning (CBL); [pedagogy] Case-Based Reasoning; [theory] Case-Based Instruction; [theory] Case-Based Reasoning; ; ; ; [technology] computational modeling; [technology] simulations; [construct] problem solving,,
49,Designing Social Infrastructure: Critical Issues in Creating Learning Environments With Technology,Bielaczyc,2006,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"If design research involving technology-based tools is going to impact educational settings, the design process must be extended beyond the tool itself to encompass a broader range of factors such as the classroom social structures (e.g., beliefs about learning and knowledge, learning activities and participant structures, configurations of both physical space and cyberspace). Although prior research has underscored the importance of classroom social structures in technology integration, it has failed to specify the critical design variables that must be taken into account. Only by understanding the critical variables involved is it possible to develop a deep understanding of how and why things work. The Social Infrastructure Framework systematically frames the critical design elements in terms of 4 dimensions: (a) cultural beliefs, (b) practices, (c) socio-techno-spatial relations, and (d) interaction with the ""outside world.""

What is needed then are the next steps of expanding the methodology to address the design problems of practical implementation prior to the steps involved in scaling up these designs. This article contributes to such an expansion through developing a systematic approach to learning from teachers' enactments of educational models. Design research focused on practical implementations by teachers can create knowledge regarding critical change processes, thus helping to create a theory of trajectories of change, or “implementation paths” (Bielaczyc & Collins, 2006a Collins, Joseph, & Bielaczyc, 2004). Here I propose using the Social Infrastructure Framework (Bielaczyc, 2006) to analyze the design of classroom social structures by developers and teachers in order to better understand their implications for constructing implementation paths. The analytic technique is exemplified through a case study involving a particular team of teachers who worked over the course of several years to adopt a knowledge-building communities approach (Bereiter, 2002; Scardamalia, 2002; Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1991 1994).

I focus on the discursive constructs of responsiveness to students’ mathematical thinking and the intellectual work in teacher and student discourse. Responsiveness to students’ mathematical thinking is the extent to which one acknowledges, elicits, takes up, or builds on student thinking in-the-moment. Intellectual work reflects the cognitive work set in motion or performed by a speaker within a given turn of talk. Methods: I developed analytic frameworks that accounted for different levels of responsiveness and intellectual work during whole-class instruction in seventh-grade mathematics classrooms. These frameworks captured variation in responsiveness and intellectual work which was linked to student achievement using MLM. Findings: Analyses revealed a significant positive relationship between teachers’ responsiveness to student thinking and student learning. Additionally, the intellectual work requested by the teacher was related to the level of intellectual work students provided, acting as an upper bound on students’ mathematical activity. Contributions: The analytic frameworks developed for this study identified forms of responsiveness (High Exploring moves) that were most effective for student learning and specified the relationship between a teacher’s and her students’ levels of intellectual work.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2021.1922413,[theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA),,,,[subject] mathematics,,[construct] participation,",discourse analysis,sociocultural theory,,,classroom discourse analysis,qualitative inquiry,,,,mathematics,secondary education,,,responsiveness,intellectual work,participation,",[theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); ; ; ; [subject] mathematics; ; [construct] participation,,

These approaches should be particularly useful because the need for scalable project-based and student-centered learning is growing considerably. In this article, we present studies focused on how students learn computer programming, based on data drawn from 154,000 code snapshots of computer programs under development by approximately 370 students enrolled in an introductory undergraduate programming course. We use methods from machine learning to discover patterns in the data and try to predict final exam grades. We begin with a set of exploratory experiments that use fully automated techniques to investigate how much students change their programming behavior throughout all assignments in the course. The results show that students’ change in programming patterns is only weakly predictive of course performance. We subsequently hone in on 1 single assignment, trying to map students’ learning process and trajectories and automatically identify productive and unproductive (sink) states within these trajectories. Results show that our process-based metric has better predictive power for final exams than the midterm grades. We conclude with recommendations about the use of such methods for assessment, real-time feedback, and course improvement.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2014.954750,[theory] Learning Analytics,[method] data mining; [method] learning analytics,[pedagogy] Project-Based Learning (PjBL),,,,[technology] artificial intelligence; [technology] data science; [technology] learning analytics,[construct] feedback,"Learning Analytics Framework, Computational Modeling Framework, Constructivist Learning Theory,machine learning, data mining, large-scale analysis,Project-Based Learning, Technology-Enhanced Learning,computer science education, undergraduate programming courses,learning analytics, programming behavior, performance prediction, feedback, automation",[theory] Learning Analytics; [method] data mining; [method] learning analytics; [pedagogy] Project-Based Learning (PjBL); ; ; ; [technology] artificial intelligence; [technology] data science; [technology] learning analytics; [construct] feedback,,

54,"Discourse, Cognition, and Chaotic Systems: An Examination of Students' Argument About Density",Bloom,2001,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article examines an extended argument about density among a small, multi-graded, middle school class of 10 studeWnts. The argument is examined from several perspectives with the primary focus on (a) the argument as an example of a chaotic and complex system, (b) the emerging development of understandings, and (c) the underlying cognitive structures affecting the students' understandings. Student talk during the class sessions were audio and videotape recorded. Each group of 3 or 4 students was individually audio recorded. A single video recorder was used to capture excerpts of each group's dialogue, as well as intergroup dialogue. The argument began after students predicted which of an assortment of different objects would or would not float. The specific case of a block of ebony initiated the argument and acted as the initial attractor, which developed into 2 opposing assertions: 1 side proposing that the pressure on a larger volume of water affects the density and the other side proposing that the molecules of water cannot be compressed. Extensive conceptual development occurred as the argument progressed with a variety of bifurcation points leading to new but related conceptual themes and higher levels of complexity. Several underlying structures, which have been referred to as interpretive frameworks (Bloom, 1992a) and p-prims (diSessa, 1993), played a central role in the development of both understandings and the argument itself. Such interpretive frameworks included (a) uniformity of molecular size and weight across different substances, (b) directionality of pressure, (c) external forces (e.g., gravity) affect pressure, (d) pressure affects density, and (e) surface area affects action of external forces on pressure.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1004new_3,[theory] Chaos Theory; [theory] Complex Systems Theory,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Microgenetic Method,,[population] middle school,,[subject] physics; [subject] science,,[construct] conceptual understanding,",chaos theory,complex systems theory,discourse analysis,,,microgenetic analysis,qualitative study,classroom video analysis,,,,middle school,science education,physics education,,,student argumentation,conceptual change,emergent systems,density,peer discourse,",[theory] Chaos Theory; [theory] Complex Systems Theory; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Microgenetic Method; ; [population] middle school; ; [subject] physics; [subject] science; ; [construct] conceptual understanding,,

56,Conjecture mapping to support vocationally educated adult learners in open-ended tasks,Boelens et al.,2020,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: This case reports on a teacher education course that aimed to support adult learners with a vocational education background to accomplish open-ended tasks. Conjecture mapping was used to identify the most salient design features, and to test if, how, and why these course features supported learners. Methods: Inspired by ethnographic approaches, sustained engagement and multiple data sources were used to explain the effects of the course design on participants’ behavior and perceptions: student and teacher interviews, observations, and artifacts. Findings: The results reveal that almost all of the proposed design features stimulated the participants toward the intended enactment processes, which in turn yielded the intended learning outcomes. For instance, worked examples (i.e., design feature) not only engendered the production of artifacts that meet high standards (i.e., enactment process) because they clarify the task requirements, but also fostered a safe structure (i.e., enactment process) by providing an overall picture of the task. Contribution: The conjecture map resulting from this study provides a theoretical frame to describe, explain, and predict how specific course design features support vocationally educated adult learners (VEAL) in open-ended tasks, and assists those who aim to implement open-ended tasks in similar contexts.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2020.1759605,[theory] Cognitive Apprenticeship; [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR),[method] Conjecture Mapping; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Mixed Methods,[pedagogy] Cognitive Apprenticeship; [pedagogy] Conjecture Mapping Framework; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Scaffolding,,,,,[construct] autonomy; [construct] reflection; [construct] scaffolding,"Conjecture Mapping Framework, Design-Based Research, Cognitive Apprenticeship,design-based intervention, mixed methods analysis,Scaffolded Problem-Solving, Vocational Learning,adult education, workplace learning,conjecture mapping, scaffolding, reflection, design iteration, learner autonomy",[theory] Cognitive Apprenticeship; [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Conjecture Mapping; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Mixed Methods; [pedagogy] Cognitive Apprenticeship; [pedagogy] Conjecture Mapping Framework; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Scaffolding; ; ; ; ; [construct] autonomy; [construct] reflection; [construct] scaffolding,,
57,Beyond the individual: The regulation and negotiation of socioemotional practices across a learning ecosystem,Borge & Xia,2023,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: In this paper, we extend theories of group cognition and regulation to examine how regulation occurs as part of a learning ecosystem. We examine our instructional approach, Embedded Design, that uses Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) as a conduit for students to make sense of their sociotechnical world and the ways people design everyday interaction around technology. Methods: Our research questions centered on identifying (RQ1) the types of problems that require students’ collective regulation, . Our population included learners aged 8-12 enrolled in a play-based after school HCI design club. Using micro-analytic techniques, we examined the HCI design processes of four teams over nine sessions and four learners over two years. Findings: We identified the most common problems students encountered, how regulation and negotiation played out across different levels of analysis, what types of learning occurred as participants worked to improve collaborative processes over time, and the role that technology played in the process. Contribution: We end the paper by proposing a model of how nested collective knowledge building processes evolve over time and discuss the implications of our findings for K-12 HCI education.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2022.2157725,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,

60,How kids manage self-directed programming projects: Strategies and structures,Brennan,2021,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: A variety of self-directed opportunities to learn how to program are available to kids. But how do kids manage the motivational and cognitive challenges of creating projects? Methods: I examined this question in the context of kids working at home with the Scratch programming environment, based on thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with 30 young creators discussing their project development processes. Findings: Ten strategies were central to kids’ progress with their projects: experimenting, planning, compromising, persevering, taking a break, asking for help, studying projects, adapting projects, creating with others, and helping others learn. Drawing on structuration theory, which frames an individual’s purposeful actions as connected to the internal and external structures to which they have access, I recast these kids’ strategies as connected to three key structures—personal interests, access to others, and time—with both enabling and inhibiting effects. Contribution: This study contributes to decades-long conversations about self-directed learning, offering a new view into the relationship between structure and self-direction by applying structuration theory to informal computer science learning. It offers a set of structures to consider when designing in support of self-direction, and acknowledges the prior problem-solving strategies that learners may bring to new areas of learning.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2021.1936531,[theory] Structuration Theory,[method] interview methods; [method] thematic analysis,,,[setting] informal learning,[subject] computer science / programming,,[construct] community; [construct] creativity; [construct] problem solving,",structuration theory,self-directed learning,,,semi-structured interviews,thematic analysis,,,,informal learning,computer science,scratch programming,,,strategies,creativity,problem solving,community,",[theory] Structuration Theory; [method] interview methods; [method] thematic analysis; ; ; [setting] informal learning; [subject] computer science / programming; ; [construct] community; [construct] creativity; [construct] problem solving,,

The same patterns of inferences occur in many different contexts. Often, in forming these inferences, people make generalizations that are equally uncertain but nevertheless are useful guides to reasoning. This article describes some important extensions to our earlier description of a core theory of plausible reasoning, based in large part on a new protocol study. The extensions are both data driven and theory driven. The primary focus here is on the inductive inference patterns people use to form plausible generalizations, that is, weakly held beliefs based on few examples but annotated with the same forms of certainty and similarity information that supported the inferential patterns described in our earlier work.

In this article, it is argued that the construct of rightful presence, and the coconstructed “making present” practices that give rise to moments of rightful presence, is 1 way to consider how to make sense of the historicized and relational nature of consequential learning. Drawing on theories of consequential learning and critical justice, we analyze ethnographic data from 3 urban middle school classrooms in 2 states during a STEM unit focused on engineering for sustainable communities. Findings: describe 2 making present practices students enacted as they engaged in engineering design: modeling ethnographic data and reperforming injustices toward solidarity building. We discuss how these practices supported moments of rightful presence in the STEM classrooms by inscribing youths’ marginalizing school experiences as a part of classroom science discourse and co-opting school science tasks as tools for exposing, critiquing, and addressing these unjust experiences.

We developed the Small-Group Scaffolding Tool (SGS-Tool) to assist teachers regarding how and when to offer support. The tool is based on three characteristics of scaffolding small groups at the group level: contingency to the group, phasing out content support when the group can continue independently, and transferring responsibility for learning to the group. Method: We investigated whether the scaffolding behavior of teachers using the SGS-Tool was more adapted to the group level than that of teachers not using the tool. Participants were four teachers and their seventh grade classes. The topic was Early Algebra. We analyzed teachers’ scaffolding behavior with one group during five lessons. Findings: The SGS-Tool offered teachers support when the groups discussed mathematics, but adaptations of the tool are needed. Overall, the SGS-Tool seems to be a promising tool for supporting mathematics teachers in scaffolding groups at the group level.

We tested the hypothesis that people would benefit more from manipulations encouraging the induction of common structure from source domains when they had previously engaged in complex encoding of those domains. Participants read sets of passages about analogous domains (i.e., topics). Each set included 1 or 2 source passages followed by a target passage. The independent variables were: (a) degree of complexity of source passage encoding; (b) amount of information about the nature of the analogy provided with the target passage (no information, a title stating that the domains were analogous, or a title stating that the domains were analogous plus a description of their common structure); and (c) number of source passages in a set (1 or 2). Participants then were tested on memory and inference for the target passage. For the memory measure, performance was better following complex encoding than following simple encoding only when the short title had been provided. For the inference measure, performance was better following complex encoding than following simple encoding only when 2 source passages had been provided. These findings support the hypothesis that complex source encoding provides the best support for the use of explicit analogy. More generally, they suggest that the effects of within-domain encoding complexity on analogical transfer depend on whether between-domain processing has been abstraction- or episode-based.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0801_2,[theory] Cognitive Psychology,[method] experimental design,,,,[subject] literacy,,,",analogical transfer,cognitive psychology,,,experimental design,memory tasks,,,,text comprehension,literacy,,,analogy,encoding,inference,",[theory] Cognitive Psychology; [method] experimental design; ; ; ; [subject] literacy; ; ,,

However, at the time of this writing no research was available to identify the epistemological frames activated by preservice science teachers (PSTs). Methods: In this research, using qualitative research methods, we studied and applied a coding scheme to identify 10 PSTs’ epistemological framing in their early teaching as part of a science teaching methods course. Three observations and three interviews of each PST served as primary data sources. Findings: We found three main epistemological frames activated. Further, we identified the contexts in which these frames were activated, where contexts can be understood as situations characterized by different possible dimensions within which resources are activated. We also described dynamics noted by PSTs related to the activation of specific epistemological resources and identified frames. Contribution: This research is a relatively new application of the epistemological framing framework that has potential to help science teacher educators better understand and support PST learning and practice.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2022.2105649,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,

STF is a multimedia information resource designed to support teachers in metaphorically visiting 3 constructivist classrooms in which they can watch a period of instruction, get perspectives on critical attributes of the teaching as they watch, and access a rich conceptual database. Pilot studies indicated that technology alone could not adequately support the teacher change process. In the primary study reported here, teachers were supported over the course of 4 months through a combination of the STF technology system and a facilitator who questioned and challenged the teachers' thinking as they worked with STF and implemented changes in their teaching. The teachers were from a small school (284 students) in a predominantly White, lower- to middle-class, rural community in which 18% received free or reduced lunches.

77,How students develop collaborative drawing to represent the transmission of sound: An analysis of explanatory scientific drawings with discourse maps,Chang et al.,2024,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: To support collaborative drawing, it is essential to investigate how students make collaborative drawings and how these contribute to elaborating their ideas. This study examines how 5th and 6th grade students’ group drawings contributed to increased levels of explanations of their drawings about sound transmission. Methods: We analyzed two cases of group drawing processes, that showed a large difference in the explanatory levels in their drawings, to find discourse patterns and visualized these patterns through discourse maps in relation to the progressions of drawing. In the first case, the students successfully co-constructed sound transmission drawings following Demand-Give-Acknowledge patterns. The students continuously questioned how to visualize particles’ vibration, used multimodal resources to generate alternative drawings, and determined most scientific drawings. In the second case, the students did not reach consensus on how to visualize particles’ vibrations, following repetitive patterns of Give-Refute. While the teacher intervened and mediated student’s conflicting ideas, the students did not generate any alternative ideas. Contribution: This study illustrates in close detail how the process of multimodal transactive discussion contributed to conceptual understanding during collaborative drawings. The discourse map may be instrumental to analyze students’ collaboration systematically and devise pedagogical approaches.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2024.2310237,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,

Building on scholarship on speculative dreaming and the interactional construction of ideological stances, this article examines the possibilities and challenges of how new, expansive, AI-supported worlds are constructed within co-design spaces.MethodologyUsing the framework of figured worlds, we analyze two social design-based workshops with high-school aged youth participants. The workshops sought to surface participants’ expansive visions for ideal collaboration in schools and to understand the affordances and constraints of AI in making those visions a reality.FindingsThe pedagogical structures of a co-design activity made salient key relationships in youth participant’s lives, which they then sought to re-envision. While assembling these speculative worlds, participants appropriated existing relationships from well-established worlds, which most commonly pulled them toward reproducing the status quo. Co-design activities that made salient familiar but alternative worlds helped to resist that pull.ContributionsIn the process of constructing expansive worlds, lived relationships from existing social worlds—both dominant and expansive—are pulled in. We introduce a world-building framework that highlights key mechanisms in this process and connects them to pedagogical structures that may support co-design participants in envisioning AI possibilities beyond the status quo.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2025.2490514,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,
79,Dynamic Mental Model Construction: A Knowledge in Pieces-Based Explanation for Computing Students’ Erratic Performance on Recursion,Chao et al.,2017,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The Knowledge in Pieces (KiP) framework offers a powerful perspective to understand the dynamic nature of knowledge and knowledge development. However, there is still much we do not know about the mechanisms underlying the moment-to-moment knowledge construction process. The purpose of this study was to explore the ways in which contextual knowledge elements support that process. According to KiP, a knowledge element, once activated, becomes part of the context that shapes the activation, configuration, and operation of other elements. Based on this assumption, we hypothesized that when the structural and operational characteristics of these contextual knowledge elements are compatible with those of the target concept, the contextual knowledge elements can support the knowledge construction process. This hypothesis was investigated in the domain of recursion, a fundamental but challenging programming concept. Sixty undergraduate computer science students completed four recursion evaluation tasks with varying likelihood to induce compatible contextual elements. Results showed that students performed better on high-compatibility tasks than on low-compatibility tasks at both the group level and individual level. Further qualitative analysis identified the knowledge elements involved and elaborated and refined the explanatory model for the contextual support effect.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2017.1392309,[theory] Cognitive Apprenticeship; [theory] Cognitive Task Analysis; [theory] Conceptual Change Theory; [theory] Mental Models Theory,[method] Cognitive Task Analysis; [method] experimental design,[pedagogy] Cognitive Apprenticeship,,,[subject] computer science / programming,,[construct] conceptual understanding,"Knowledge-in-Pieces Framework, Cognitive Science Theory of Misconceptions, Conceptual Change,cognitive task analysis, experimental study,Cognitive Apprenticeship,computing education, undergraduate programming courses,mental models, misconceptions, knowledge organization, debugging, conceptual understanding",[theory] Cognitive Apprenticeship; [theory] Cognitive Task Analysis; [theory] Conceptual Change Theory; [theory] Mental Models Theory; [method] Cognitive Task Analysis; [method] experimental design; [pedagogy] Cognitive Apprenticeship; ; ; [subject] computer science / programming; ; [construct] conceptual understanding,,

Methods: We used a randomized controlled trial with an embedded case study to examine the efficacy of a year-long video-based PD program using the CDA. Findings: The 24 intervention teachers significantly increased their use of productive talk moves in mathematics classrooms relative to the 22 comparison teachers (Cohen’s d = 0.67 to 2.35, p <.05). Moreover, a linear mixed model analysis showed that 882 students of the intervention teachers had significantly higher mathematics achievement scores than the 625 comparison students (Cohen’s d = 0.24, p <.05). The case study showed that CDA’s multiple representations of classroom discourse and interactive, process-oriented visualizations facilitated the teachers’ navigation of classroom video data. Additionally, video and visualizations prompted the teachers to reflect on the data with their peers for evidence-based reasoning and discussion. Contribution: This study demonstrates the efficacy of a video-based PD program for increasing classroom discourse and student learning. It also informs the design of visualizations to enrich video-based PD.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2020.1783269,,[method] experimental design,,[population] in-service teachers,[setting] teacher professional development,,,,"Dialogic Teaching Framework, Teacher Professional Learning Framework,experimental design, discourse coding analysis,Video-Based Reflection, Discourse-Oriented Professional Learning,teacher professional development, classroom discourse interventions,dialogic teaching, professional learning, classroom talk, student engagement, teacher growth",; [method] experimental design; ; [population] in-service teachers; [setting] teacher professional development; ; ; ,,
81,The role of individual preparation before collaboration: An exploratory study on students’ computer-supported collaborative argumentation in a primary classroom,Chen et al.,2024,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Collaborative learning is widely applied in real-world classrooms while young learners still have challenges engaging in high-quality knowledge co-construction processes. Researchers suggested an individual preparation activity before collaboration. However, there remains a limited understanding of the role of individual preparation on students’ collaborative learning. Method: Conducted in a fifth-grade English language class in a Singapore primary school, this study explored students’ collaborative learning outcome and process under two conditions: individual preparation before collaboration (With-IP) and immediate collaboration (Without-IP) conditions. Student groups’ collaborative argumentation artifacts were collected and coded. Process analysis was conducted to reveal the distribution and transitional pattern of students’ verbal discussions and online collaboration behaviors. Findings: This study reveals that individual preparation (With-IP) significantly enhanced the quality of collaborative argumentation compared to no preparation (Without-IP), by fostering more idea elaboration, deeper engagement with content knowledge, and higher quality of arguments. However, the students were also found to make more coordination and regulation efforts in the With-IP condition than Without-IP condition. Contribution: This research underscores the role of individual preparation on collaborative learning processes and outcomes. This insight is pivotal for educators and practitioners in tailoring collaboration scripts to the objectives of classroom teaching and learning.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2024.2397761,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,
82,A framework for infrastructuring sustainable innovations in education,Chen,2024,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Learning scientists have historically been interested in understanding how learning happens and in creating innovations to facilitate learning in real-world situations. Recently, the field has recognized that advancing standalone innovations is not enough to address systemic problems in education; instead, the focus must be broadened to sustain these innovations. Drawing on an interdisciplinary body of literature on infrastructure, this paper presents a framework—the IMPROV framework—that offers theoretical, methodological, and practical tools for infrastructuring innovations in the learning sciences. Infrastructuring can be defined as the ongoing process of creating functional infrastructures for activities in a particular context. I describe six inter-connected areas of infrastructuring to highlight ways that learning designers and researchers could surface existing infrastructures, facilitate coherence-making negotiation activities, engage practitioners in collaborative design, and continuously evaluate infrastructuring activities. It is hoped that such advances will increase the relevance and sustainability of innovations in education and provide infrastructure to further improve them.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2024.2320159,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,
83,Planning for student-driven discussions: A revelatory case of curricular sensemaking for epistemic agency,Cherbow & McNeill,2022,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Teachers need to make sense of curricular materials and design instruction to ensure students will be positioned to pursue their own arc of inquiry in curriculum enactment. Whole-group discussions are crucial opportunities for curricular sensemaking, yet planning and enactment can be challenging. Methods: We used a single, revelatory case study approach with one focal teacher to research curricular sensemaking for epistemic agency in storyline materials. We identified episodes of pedagogical reasoning for epistemic agency in the teacher’s pre- and post-interview responses and participation in discussion planning cycles (DPCs). This analysis revealed the recurrent sources of tension and ambiguity that the teacher grappled with concerning epistemic agency. FIndings: The teacher made sense of two key sources of tension: curricular coherence and student coherence-seeking; equitable participation and incremental building of ideas; and one source of ambiguity: uniform or variable form(s) of epistemic agency in different discussion types. The teacher grappled with these tensions and ambiguity and learned to leverage them to position students with epistemic agency in their learning. Contribution: The teacher engaged in curricular sensemaking for epistemic agency. This form of sensemaking involves the teacher’s efforts to engage with students’ emergent ideas and participation in their use of curricular materials.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2021.2024433,,,,,,[subject] science,,[construct] agency; [construct] epistemic agency; [construct] Epistemic Agency; [construct] equity,"Epistemic Agency Framework, Curricular Sensemaking Theory, Ambitious Science Teaching,revelatory case study, teacher interview and planning analysis,Student-Driven Discussion, Epistemic Agency Pedagogy,science education, middle school classroom,epistemic agency, curricular sensemaking, teacher learning, coherence, equity",; ; ; ; ; [subject] science; ; [construct] agency; [construct] epistemic agency; [construct] Epistemic Agency; [construct] equity,,
84,The Content of Physics Self-Explanations,Chi & VanLehn,1991,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Several earlier studies have found the amount learned while studying worked-out examples is proportional to the number of self-explanations generated while studying examples. A self-explanation is a comment about an example statement that contains domain-relevant information over and above what was stated in the example line itself. This article analyzes the specific content of self-explanations generated by students while studying physics examples. In particular, the content is analyzed into pieces of constituent knowledge that were used in the comments. These were further analyzed in order to trace the source of knowledge from which selfexplanations could be generated. The results suggest that there are two general sources for self-explanations. The first is deduction from knowledge acquired earlier while reading the text part of the chapter, usually by simply instantiating a general principle, concept, or procedure with information in the current example statement. The second explanation is generalization and extension of the example statements. Such construction of the content of the example statements yield new general knowledge that helps complete the students' otherwise incomplete understanding of the domain principles and concepts.

Although the application of the method is illustrated in the context of verbal data such as explanations, interviews, problem-solving protocols, and retrospective reports, in principle, the mechanics of the method can be adapted for coding other types of qualitative data, such as gestures and videotapes. The mechanics of the method are outlined in 8 concrete steps. Although verbal analyses can be used for many purposes, the main goal of the analyses discussed here is to formulate an understanding of the representation of the knowledge used in cognitive performances and how that representation changes with learning. This can be contrasted with another method of analyzing verbal protocols, the goal of which is to validate the cognitive processes of human performance, often as embodied in a computational model.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0603_1,[theory] Grounded Theory,[method] coding and categorization; [method] Grounded Theory; [method] protocol analysis; [method] qualitative coding; [method] validity testing,,,,,[technology] data science,,",verbal analysis,cognitive process modeling,grounded theory,,,qualitative coding,inter-rater reliability analysis,protocol analysis,,,,research methodology,learning sciences methods,,,verbal data,coding reliability,methodological rigor,data quantification,",[theory] Grounded Theory; [method] coding and categorization; [method] Grounded Theory; [method] protocol analysis; [method] qualitative coding; [method] validity testing; ; ; ; ; [technology] data science; ,,
86,Commonsense Conceptions of Emergent Processes: Why Some Misconceptions Are Robust,Chi,2005,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article offers a plausible domain-general explanation for why some concepts of processes are resistant to instructional remediation although other, apparently similar concepts are more easily understood. The explanation assumes that processes may differ in ontological ways: that some processes (such as the apparent flow in diffusion of dye in water) are emergent and other processes (such as the flow of blood in human circulation) are direct. Although precise definition of the two kinds of processes are probably impossible, attributes of direct and emergent processes are described that distinguish them in a domain-general way. Circulation and diffusion, which are used as examples of direct and emergent processes, are associated with different kinds of misconceptions. The claim is that students' misconceptions for direct kinds of processes, such as blood circulation, are of the same ontological kind as the correct conception, suggesting that misconceptions of direct processes may be nonrobust. However, students' misconceptions of emergent processes are robust because they misinterpret emergent processes as a kind of commonsense direct processes. To correct such a misconception requires a re-representation or a conceptual shift across ontological kinds. Therefore, misconceptions of emergent processes are robust because such a shift requires that students know about the emergent kind and can overcome their (perhaps even innate) predisposition to conceive of all processes as a direct kind. Such a domain-general explanation suggests that teaching students the causal structure underlying emergent processes may enable them to recognize and understand a variety of emergent processes for which they have robust misconceptions, such as concepts of electricity, heat and temperature, and evolution.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls1402_1,[theory] Cognitive Psychology; [theory] Conceptual Change Theory,[method] coding and categorization; [method] interview methods; [method] qualitative coding,,,,[subject] science,,[construct] conceptual understanding,"Conceptual Change Theory, Cognitive Psychology,interviews, qualitative coding,Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL),science, secondary education,misconceptions, conceptual understanding, reasoning",[theory] Cognitive Psychology; [theory] Conceptual Change Theory; [method] coding and categorization; [method] interview methods; [method] qualitative coding; ; ; ; [subject] science; ; [construct] conceptual understanding,,
87,Why Students Learn More From Dialogue- Than Monologue-Videos: Analyses of Peer Interactions,Chi et al.,2016,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"In 2 separate studies, we found that college-age students learned more when they collaboratively watched tutorial dialogue-videos than lecture-style monologue-videos. In fact, they can learn as well as the tutees in the dialogue-videos. These results replicate similar findings in the literature showing the advantage of dialogue-videos even when observers watched them individually. However, having the observing students watch collaboratively as dyads provided data to carry out in-depth analyses of their conversations and activities in order to understand why dialogue-videos are superior to monologue-videos. Toward that goal, transcripts of video dialogues and monologues, as well as peer-to-peer conversations of the observing students collected in a prior study, were analyzed using the ICAP (interactive, constructive, active, passive) framework as a lens. Three sets of analyses were carried out. The 1st set focused on the content of the videos in terms of the tutors’ and the tutees’ moves. The 2nd set focused on the activities and behaviors of the collaboratively observing dyads. The 3rd set focused on the role of the tutees in the dialogue-videos in eliciting constructive and interactive engagement from the observing students. Our analyses suggest that dialogue-videos naturally elicited more constructive and interactive engagement behaviors from the observers than the monologue-videos, which in turn mediated the observers’ own learning.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2016.1204546,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,
88,Effect of an Animated Classroom Story Embedded in Online Discussion on Helping Mathematics Teachers Learn to Notice,Chieu et al.,2011,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Rich-media representations of teaching using animated cartoons can be effective at stimulating teachers' discussion about practice and hence help them learn productively from one another about their profession. Our research aims to design web-based interactive rich-media virtual settings for teachers to learn to do the practice of teaching. For that purpose, we seek a set of operational design principles that could be used to optimally exploit web-based interactive rich-media technologies. By operational design principles, we mean guidelines that facilitate decision making in the creation of learning conditions. In this article, we report on a study of the effect of embedded animated clips of instructional practice in online interactive forum/chat to support teachers in learning to notice and interpret critical events of classroom interactions. The study showed that both novice and experienced teachers actively participated in discussion and effectively noticed important events of teaching practice. The main findings include the following: (a) Embedding animated representations of teaching in forum/chat, by serving as a common point of reference, helps both novice and experienced teachers effectively notice and discuss noteworthy events in teaching practice; (b) forum suits novice teachers better than chat; and (c) both forum and chat suit experienced teachers in different ways.

89,Supporting Argumentation Through Students' Questions: Case Studies in Science Classrooms,Chin & Osborne,2010,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This study explores how student-generated questions can support argumentation in science. Students were asked to discuss which of two graphs showing the change in temperature with time when ice is heated to steam was correct. Four classes of students, aged 12–14 years, from two countries, first wrote questions about the phenomenon. Then, working in groups with members who differed in their views, they discussed possible answers. To help them structure their arguments, students were given a sheet with prompts to guide their thinking and another sheet on which to represent their argument diagrammatically. One group of students from each class was audiotaped. Data from both students' written work and the taped oral discourse were then analyzed for types of questions asked, the content and function of their talk, and the quality of arguments elicited. To illustrate the dynamic interaction between students' questions and the evolution of their arguments, the discourse of one group is presented as a case study and comparative analyses made with the discourse from the other three groups. Emerging from our analysis is a tentative explanatory model of how different forms of interaction and, in particular, questioning are needed for productive argumentation to occur.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400903530036,[theory] Argumentation Theory,[method] Case Study Research; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Interaction / Video Analysis,[pedagogy] Scaffolding,,[setting] secondary education,[subject] science,,[construct] argumentation; [construct] participation; [construct] scaffolding,"Argumentation Theory, Socratic Questioning, Inquiry-Based Science Education (IBSE),case study, discourse analysis, video analysis,Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL), Argumentation-Based Pedagogy,science education, secondary classrooms, adolescents,questioning, argumentation, reasoning, participation, scaffolding",[theory] Argumentation Theory; [method] Case Study Research; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [pedagogy] Scaffolding; ; [setting] secondary education; [subject] science; ; [construct] argumentation; [construct] participation; [construct] scaffolding,,
90,Educating and Measuring Choice: A Test of the Transfer of Design Thinking in Problem Solving and Learning,Chin et al.,2019,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Educators aim to equip students with learning strategies they can apply when approaching new problems on their own. Teaching design-thinking strategies may support this goal. A first test would show that the strategies are good for learning and that students spontaneously transfer them beyond classroom instruction. To examine this, we introduce choice-based assessments (CBAs). CBAs measure how people learn when there is minimal guidance and they must make decisions as independent learners. Here, sixth-grade students completed multiple design activities that emphasized either seeking constructive criticism or exploring a space of alternatives. Afterward, they completed the CBAs, which measured strategy transfer. Results showed that lower-achieving students benefitted most from instruction, exhibiting a relative increase in their use of design-thinking strategies. In addition, strategy choices correlated with prior achievement measures and appeared to mediate performance in and learning from the CBAs. The choices to use the two strategies themselves were not correlated, which indicates that they are not subsets of a larger construct, such as growth mindset. In sum, CBAs enabled a double demonstration: design-thinking strategies may improve learning and problem solving, and design-thinking instruction may improve the likelihood of lower-achieving students choosing to use effective strategies in novel settings that require new learning.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2019.1570933,,[method] Design Thinking Research; [method] experimental design,[pedagogy] Design Thinking for Education,,,[subject] STEM,,[construct] problem solving; [construct] transfer,"Design Thinking Framework, Preparation for Future Learning (PFL), Learning Transfer Theory,experimental design, choice-based assessment,Design Thinking Instruction, Reflective Problem Solving,STEM education, middle school design-based activities,transfer, design thinking, strategy use, learning to learn, future learning",; [method] Design Thinking Research; [method] experimental design; [pedagogy] Design Thinking for Education; ; ; [subject] STEM; ; [construct] problem solving; [construct] transfer,,

Groups with higher mathematics grades or more CCs were more likely to solve the problem. Dynamic multilevel analysis statistically identified watersheds (breakpoints) that divided each group's conversation into distinct time periods with many CCs versus few CCs, and modeled the groups' 2,951 conversation turns. Wrong contributions, correct evaluations of one another's ideas, justifications, and polite disagreements increased the likelihood of a CC. In contrast, questions, rude disagreements, and agreements reduced it. Justifications had the largest effects, whereas the effects of correct evaluations lasted 3 speaker turns. Some effects differed across groups or time periods. In groups that solved the problem, justifications were more likely to yield CCs, and questions were more likely to elicit explanations. Meanwhile, the effects of agreements and correct evaluations on CCs differed across time periods. Applied to practice, teachers can encourage students to evaluate others' ideas carefully and politely, express and justify their own ideas, and explain their answers to group members' questions.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400802224830,[theory] Social Constructivism,[method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [theory] Interaction Analysis,[pedagogy] Collaborative Learning,,[setting] secondary education,[subject] mathematics,,[construct] collaboration; [construct] participation,"Social Constructivism, Statistical Discourse Analysis Framework, Group Cognition,statistical discourse analysis, interaction analysis,Collaborative Learning, Peer Discussion,mathematics, secondary classrooms,discourse flow, collaboration, correctness, reasoning, participation",[theory] Social Constructivism; [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [theory] Interaction Analysis; [pedagogy] Collaborative Learning; ; [setting] secondary education; [subject] mathematics; ; [construct] collaboration; [construct] participation,,

However, very little is known about how this dialogue may progress in the sense of critically linking ideas in coherent lines of collective inquiry. This article investigates this issue by analyzing 4 consecutive sessions of a science class with children ages 8 to 10 and identifies a social mechanism that can explain the emergence of progressiveness in collective inquiry. The identified mechanism consists of a series of iterations of the sequence (Direction) → Inference ↔ Observation ↔ Consensus → Fixation. This sequence enables the transition from local to collective agency and meaning. Direction creates a gap in a semantic structure, leading to the local formation of an inference. This inference then escalates through observation and consensus before finally being fixed through the creation of an artifact that reifies it as a collective meaning. Based on this collective meaning, a new direction leads to a new local inference, and the cycle begins again.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2018.1555756,[theory] Communities of Practice; [theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Participatory Design Research,[pedagogy] Collaborative Learning; [pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL),,,,,[construct] participation,"Sociocultural Theory, Collective Inquiry Framework,classroom discourse analysis, qualitative case study,Inquiry-Based Learning, Collaborative Knowledge Construction,general education, classroom whole-group discussion,collective inquiry, progressivity, discourse moves, participation, knowledge advancement",[theory] Communities of Practice; [theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Participatory Design Research; [pedagogy] Collaborative Learning; [pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL); ; ; ; ; [construct] participation,,

More specifically, the current study explores two potential explanations for the conflicting results reported by CitationIoannides and Vosniadou (2002)and CitationdiSessa, Gillespie, and Esterly (2004) in terms of differences in coding schemes and differences in student populations. The current study addresses these questions by applying the coding schemes from both studies to interviews with 201 students drawn from the United States, the Philippines, Turkey, China, and Mexico. The analyses focus first on the coding schemes, suggesting that differences in coding schemes seem unlikely to account for the differences in the original studies. The analyses then focus on potential differences between student populations, suggesting that some differences exist in terms of consistency and meanings that might result from language, culture, or educational systems, but that these differences are too small to account for the radical differences in the findings of the original studies. Two additional explanations are then proposed and explored involving the instruments and the epistemological stances invoked for the students.

We propose a framework for conceptualizing pre-service teachers’ stances toward designerly thinking. Methods: We developed the framework following Crismond and Adams’ scholarship of integration approach combined with an inductive content analysis of 43 pre-service teachers’ conceptualizations of design across two versions of a design course. Results: The resulting framework focuses on six dimensions including: (a) co-evolution of problem frames and possible solutions, (b) problem complexity and structure, (c) idea fluency and scope, (d) inquiry and stakeholder engagement, (e) conceptualization of the design process, and (f) attitude toward ambiguity. Each dimension articulates anchor points and examples based on the literature and grounded content analysis of the data. The analysis and discussion consider the conceptual accessibility of the framework’s goals for pre-service teachers and whether they considered the goals feasible to implement in the context of curricular mandates. Conclusion: The proposed framework provides the foundation for a hypothetical learning trajectory that can be elaborated and validated through future research to support K12 teachers in their development as informed designers who might better serve the needs of all their students.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2024.2397762,,[method] content analysis; [method] Design Thinking Research,[pedagogy] backward design; [pedagogy] Design Thinking for Education,,[setting] teacher education,,,[construct] ambiguity,",design thinking,backward design,scholarship of integration,,,inductive content analysis,framework development,design course analysis,,,,teacher education,pre-service teacher preparation,design courses,,,designerly stance,problem framing,stakeholder engagement,ambiguity,teacher design capacity,",; [method] content analysis; [method] Design Thinking Research; [pedagogy] backward design; [pedagogy] Design Thinking for Education; ; [setting] teacher education; ; ; [construct] ambiguity,,
95,Designing for Knowledge Integration: The Impact of Instructional Time,Clark & Linn,2003,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Science educators face constant tradeoffs between allocating time to important topics and including more topics in the curriculum. We study 3,000 students experiencing 4 increasingly streamlined versions of a computer-enhanced middle school thermodynamics curriculum to investigate the impact of instructional time on knowledge integration. Knowledge integration refers to the process of adding new ideas and sorting through connections to develop a cohesive account of scientific phenomena. Our analyses contrast performance on inquiry assessments that require knowledge integration with performance on multiple-choice items. The results show that decreasing instructional time is strongly and significantly related to diminishing student knowledge integration around complex concepts. Whereas the inquiry assessments capture the impact of decreasing instructional time on knowledge integration, the multiple-choice assessments are relatively insensitive to these decreases. To explore further the process of knowledge integration, we follow 50 students through the full curriculum. We then analyze the performance of 1 representative student from middle school through high school. These case studies show why packing the curriculum with many science topics results in superficial understanding for many students. We show why deep understanding of science requires sustained study of carefully designed materials.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1204_1,[theory] Constructivism; [theory] Knowledge Integration Framework,[method] Constructivism (Research Paradigm); [method] interview methods; [method] quasi-experimental design; [method] surveys,,,[setting] online learning,[subject] science,,[construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] knowledge; [construct] reflection,"Knowledge Integration Framework, Constructivism,quasi-experimental design, surveys, interviews,Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL),science, middle school classrooms, online learning,conceptual understanding, knowledge integration, reflection",[theory] Constructivism; [theory] Knowledge Integration Framework; [method] Constructivism (Research Paradigm); [method] interview methods; [method] quasi-experimental design; [method] surveys; ; ; [setting] online learning; [subject] science; ; [construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] knowledge; [construct] reflection,,

Mental Leaps, by Keith Holyoak and Paul Thagard offers a number of implications for educators in the discussion of the cognitive functions of analogy. The second book, Engines for Education by Roger Schank and Chip Cleary, is more directly aimed at educators in its proposals about effective uses of educational software. After summarizing the two books, I will consider their implications and value for educators attempting to facilitate conceptual change and the development of thinking skills in students.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1101_6,[theory] Conceptual Change Theory; [theory] Structure-Mapping Theory,[method] comparative analysis; [method] experimental design,[pedagogy] Case-Based Learning (CBL); [pedagogy] Case-Based Reasoning; [pedagogy] Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL); [theory] Case-Based Instruction; [theory] Case-Based Reasoning,,,[subject] science,[technology] computer-supported learning; [technology] simulations,[construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] transfer,"Structure-Mapping Theory, Case-Based Reasoning, Conceptual Change Theory,comparative analysis, experimental design,Case-Based Learning (CBL), Computer-Supported Learning Environments,science, secondary education, simulations,analogy, transfer, conceptual understanding",[theory] Conceptual Change Theory; [theory] Structure-Mapping Theory; [method] comparative analysis; [method] experimental design; [pedagogy] Case-Based Learning (CBL); [pedagogy] Case-Based Reasoning; [pedagogy] Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL); [theory] Case-Based Instruction; [theory] Case-Based Reasoning; ; ; [subject] science; [technology] computer-supported learning; [technology] simulations; [construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] transfer,,
100,"Step-Wise Evolution of Mental Models of Electric C ircuits: A ""Learning-Aloud"" Case Study",Clement & Steinberg,2002,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Various methods have been tried for fostering conceptual change in science including the use of analogies, discrepant events, and visual models. In this article we describe an approach to teaching complex models in science that takes a model construction cycle of generation, evaluation, and modification as an organizing framework for thinking about when to use each of the previous strategies. This approach of model evolution uses all of the previous methods as students are led to reassess and revise their model many times in the course of the lessons.We reported on the case study of a student in a tutoring experiment using this approach in the study of electric circuits. We concentrated on the student's moments of surprise as motivators of conceptual change. Most of these came from discrepant events, but 1 of them appeared to come from the student's own sensed lack of coherence in an intermediate model. In this case study, the teaching method appears to lead to the construction of an explanatory model that is fairly deeply understood by the student in the sense that it can generate predictions and coherent explanations of a complex system in a transfer problem.Some of our conclusions and hypotheses generated with respect to learning processes are as follows: (a) Discrepant events produced reactions of surprise and were eventually followed by model revisions, leading us to hypothesize a motivating and guiding role for these events; (b) the subject was able to map and apply an air pressure analogy used for electric potential and continued to exhibit traces of it through the posttest interview; (c) the subject's spontaneous use of similar depictive hand motions during the instruction and during the posttest provides initial evidence that the instruction fostered development of dynamic mental models, such as those of fluid-like flows caused by pressure differences, that can generate new mental simulations for understanding relatively difficult transfer problems. This leads us to describe the core of her new knowledge as explanatory models at an intermediate level of generality that allow her to run imagistic simulations and to hypothesize a ""transfer of runnability"" from the analog conception to the model in this case; (d) we hypothesize that the process underlying model generations and revisions was 1 of scaffolded abductive knowledge construction rather than induction or deduction; that evaluation and revision cycles can make up for the conjectural nature of individual abductions; and that engagement and comprehension in the cycle was fostered by small step sizes for revisions from using multiple ""small"" discrepant events and analogies built into the lessons.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1104_1,[theory] Cognitive Theory,[method] comparative analysis; [method] experimental design,,,[setting] higher education,[subject] science,,[construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] problem solving; [construct] transfer,"Cognitive Theory, Analogical Reasoning, Conceptual Change,Experimental Study, Comparative Analysis,Case-Based Learning (CBL),science, higher education, computer simulations,analogy, transfer, conceptual change, problem solving",[theory] Cognitive Theory; [method] comparative analysis; [method] experimental design; ; ; [setting] higher education; [subject] science; ; [construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] problem solving; [construct] transfer,,

These challenges involved (a) situating teachers' activity in the institutional setting of the schools and district in which they worked, (b) developing an interpretive framework that enabled us to document the collective learning of teacher groups, and (c) reconceptualizing the relations between teachers' activity in professional development sessions and in their classrooms. For each challenge, we describe both the initial approach that we developed while preparing for the experiment and the modifications that we found it necessary to make once the experiment was in progress. Our goal in sharing these reflections from the field is to contribute to the task of extending the design experiment methodology to investigate the learning of groups of practicing teachers rather than groups of students.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400902797933,[theory] (Cultural-Historical) Activity Theory (CHAT); [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR),[method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Practice-Based Research,[pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR),[population] in-service teachers; [population] teachers,,,,[construct] reflection,"Design-Based Research (DBR), Teacher Learning Framework, Activity Theory,design-based research, reflective analysis,Design-Based Professional Development,mathematics and science teacher education, in-service teachers,design experiment, reflection, practice-based research, teacher learning, methodology",[theory] (Cultural-Historical) Activity Theory (CHAT); [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Practice-Based Research; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [population] in-service teachers; [population] teachers; ; ; ; [construct] reflection,,
104,Analyzing Educational Policies: A Learning Design Perspective,Cobb & Jackson,2012,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"In this article we describe and illustrate an analytical perspective in which educational policies are viewed as designs for supporting learning. From the learning design perspective, a policy comprises 3 components that we term the what, how, and why of policy: the goals for the learning of members of the group targeted by the policy, the supports for their learning, and an often implicit rationale for why these supports might be effective. We unpack the how of policy by describing 4 types of support for learning: new positions, learning events, new organizational routines, and new tools. Based on our discussion of the rationale for each type of support we conjecture that policies that are effective in supporting consequential professional learning will involve some combination of new positions that provide expert guidance, ongoing intentional learning events in which tools are used to bridge to practice, carefully designed organizational routines carried out with a more knowledgeable other, and the use of new tools whose incorporation into practice is supported. We present an analysis of a policy that was central to an urban district's efforts to support middle school mathematics teachers' development of ambitious instructional practices. The data that we analyzed included audio-recorded interviews conducted with teachers, mathematics coaches, school leaders, and district leaders. The sample analysis illustrates that the learning design perspective is useful both when designing policies and when revising policies after implementation to make them more effective.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2011.630849,[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Organizational Learning Theory,[method] Qualitative Inquiry,,[population] in-service teachers,[setting] teacher professional development,,,,"Learning Design Framework, Organizational Learning Theory, Policy as Design Perspective,policy analysis, interview study, qualitative analysis,Teacher Professional Development,mathematics education policy, urban school districts,policy design, learning supports, professional learning, instructional reform, organizational routine",[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Organizational Learning Theory; [method] Qualitative Inquiry; ; [population] in-service teachers; [setting] teacher professional development; ; ; ,,

In recent years, learning scientists have explored the connections between learning and various types of identities, including disciplinary identity, gender, race, and more. In this article we focus on national identity, to understand how it is constructed and how it might be made more inclusive through learning. Methods: Drawing on sociolinguistics and discourse analysis methods, we present a telling case study aimed at elucidating previously obscure theoretical relations by providing a rich and detailed account of a single student whose national identity shifted over the course of a school year. Findings: Our analysis shows how Joshua, a 9th grade secular Jewish-Israeli student, constructed his national identity. Joshua’s identity developed across three stages, which were marked by a shift from an essentialist disposition to a constructionist one and by an increasing sense of belonging. Contribution: We highlight a connection between learners’ views on the continuum between essentialism and constructionism and their degree of belongingness. Our findings suggest that a constructionist approach to identity can translate into a greater sense of belonging and help ameliorate some cases of social marginalization.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2023.2185147,[theory] Constructionism; [theory] Identity Theory; [theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] Case Study Research; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] longitudinal study,[pedagogy] Constructionism,,,[subject] civic education; [subject] social studies,,[construct] belonging; [construct] inclusion,",sociocultural theory,identity theory,discourse analysis,,,telling case study,discourse analysis,longitudinal study,,,,secondary education,Israel,civic education,social studies,,,national identity,belonging,inclusion,essentialism,constructionism,marginalization ,",[theory] Constructionism; [theory] Identity Theory; [theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] Case Study Research; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] longitudinal study; [pedagogy] Constructionism; ; ; [subject] civic education; [subject] social studies; ; [construct] belonging; [construct] inclusion,,

108,The Effect of Instructional Explanations on Learning From Scientific Texts,Coleman et al.,1997,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This study explored the influence of offering different instructions to undergraduate students prior to their learning an expository text on evolutionary biology. Participants were asked to either explain, summarize, or listen to another's explanation or summary of Darwin's theory of evolution through natural selection. Three conditions were compared: In Condition 1, students were told to study the text because they were going to teach the contents of the text to their partner by either explaining or summarizing (these are referred to as the teach through explanation or summary conditions). In Condition 2, 2 different groups of participants were told to study the identical material on evolution and either explain or summarize the contents of the text aloud to the experimenter following the study period. However, they were only told to do so after they were finished studying for themselves. These are referred to as the explain or summarize to self conditions. In Condition 3, 2 different groups did not read the text for themselves. They were told that their partner was preparing to teach them a text on evolution and that they should listen carefully to their partner's explanation or summary because they would be asked some questions afterwards. These 2 groups are referred to as the hearers (50% listened to an explanation and 50% listened to a summarization). Overall, explainers outperformed summarizers on a far transfer task dealing with evolution. Moreover, the teach through explaination condition had the strongest effect on students' learning from text as measured by their performance on (a) an explanation-summary task, and on (b) evolutionary near and far transfer problems.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0604_1,[theory] Constructivism,[method] Constructivism (Research Paradigm); [method] experimental design,[pedagogy] Peer Learning / Teaching,,,[subject] science,,,",explanation-based learning,constructivism,peer teaching,,,experimental study,text comprehension tasks,,,,undergraduate education,science learning,,,instructional explanation,summarization,peer explanation,transfer of learning ,",[theory] Constructivism; [method] Constructivism (Research Paradigm); [method] experimental design; [pedagogy] Peer Learning / Teaching; ; ; [subject] science; ; ,,

Drawing on interviews with 25 former youth organizers from the program, this study explores the lessons that stay with them as they transition to young adulthood and the factors they believe facilitated this lasting learning. Results show that the learning outcomes and the features of the learning environment that the participants identify reflect key tenets of Freirean critical pedagogy. As young adults, the participants indicate that they continue to draw on the critical thinking, introspection, communication, and interpersonal skills they developed as youth organizers, and they highlight the value of relevant content, an open atmosphere for discussion and debate, and peer education in promoting such durable learning.

116,Gestures at Work in Sense-Making Science Talk,Crowder,1996,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Emerging research suggests that problem solvers employ distinctive gestures as they strive to explain scientific phenomena. Because the learning sciences increasingly assign explanation a central role in science learning (Chi, Bassok, Lewis, Reimann, & Glaser, 1989; Linn & Songer, 1993; Morrison, Newman, Crowder, & Théberge, 1993), distinguishing descriptions from explanations on the basis of associated gestures could prove a useful research and teaching tool. Extending the work of McNeill (1992) and others, this article outlines a way of coding gestures that allows observers to distinguish explanation discourse from other forms of science talk. Sixth-grade science learners gesture differently depending on their discourse mode. When explaining in-the-moment, students gesture in ways that help them to predict, revise, and coordinate elements in a model. In contrast, when they describe a memorized or previously thought-out model, students time their gestures to redundantly emphasize speech. Gesture perspective, or where the speaker stands in relation to the discourse, also distinguishes descriptive transmission of knowledge from self-explanations. Whereas a describer maintains distance between himself or herself and his or her gestures, the in-the-moment explainer steps into the gesture space, assuming an inside observer perspective. In conclusion, gesture assists in the construction as well as the communication of scientific insights.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0503_2,[theory] Embodied Cognition; [theory] Multimodal Discourse Theory; [theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [theory] Interaction Analysis,[pedagogy] Collaborative Learning,,[setting] science classrooms,,,[construct] collaboration; [construct] gesture; [construct] meaning making,",embodied cognition,multimodal discourse,sociocultural theory,,,interaction analysis,video-based microanalysis,,,,science classrooms,collaborative learning,,,gesture,multimodal communication,meaning-making,embodied reasoning,",[theory] Embodied Cognition; [theory] Multimodal Discourse Theory; [theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [theory] Interaction Analysis; [pedagogy] Collaborative Learning; ; [setting] science classrooms; ; ; [construct] collaboration; [construct] gesture; [construct] meaning making,,

In classrooms, this personal and social process is made concrete through dialogue. Methods: This paper presents an illustrative case study of how sixth-grade student, Jo, developed voice through interaction with peers in a classroom context while making art about social issues. Interaction analysis methods supported inquiry into Jo’s talk about art making as she talked with peers in designed conversation spaces (i.e., intentional structures and opportunities to talk about artwork while making it). Findings: Jo’s voice development illustrates the collaborative nature of voice as an interactional accomplishment; having a unique voice is something students might strive to achieve as artists, yet that voice is co-constructed through collective social interaction as students take up, appropriate, and build on others’ ideas. Artistic and political dimensions of art making were generative. Contribution: Pedagogical implications are discussed for designing socially supported learning experiences in arts classrooms. What Jo’s case makes evident is that voice can be supported in classrooms through intentional pedagogical choices that create the conditions for that voice to develop through interactions with peers and materials.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2022.2091442,[theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] Case Study Research; [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [theory] Interaction Analysis,,,,,,[construct] collaboration; [construct] interaction; [construct] voice,"Sociocultural Theory, Voice and Identity Framework, Art-Based Learning Theory,case study, interaction analysis,Arts-Based Pedagogy, Socially Engaged Art Pedagogy,art education, middle school classroom,voice, interaction, social issues, artistic expression, collaboration",[theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] Case Study Research; [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [theory] Interaction Analysis; ; ; ; ; ; [construct] collaboration; [construct] interaction; [construct] voice,,

The aim of the study is to shed light on the notion of shared epistemic agency and to create empirical grounding for its theoretical description. The current study provides an account of the construct, based on a review of several theoretical conceptualizations and on the analysis of empirical material from 2 case studies from university education. We investigate shared epistemic agency within the specific framework of the knowledge creation perspective on learning, viewing it as the capacity that enables deliberate collaborative efforts of groups to create shared knowledge objects. Our study identifies and describes 2 core dimensions of shared epistemic agency: the epistemic and the regulative dimensions. We identify actions within each dimension that indicate the manifestation of shared epistemic agency in the practice of collaborative creation of shared knowledge objects. This study also distinguishes patterns of action that provide indications of how shared epistemic agency is differently articulated in the 2 groups' collaborative object-oriented activities.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508401003708381,,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Mixed Methods,,,,[subject] science,,[construct] agency; [construct] collaboration; [construct] epistemic agency; [construct] Epistemic Agency; [construct] metacognition,"Knowledge Building Theory, Epistemic Agency Framework, Collaborative Learning Theory,mixed methods, discourse analysis, survey study,Collaborative Knowledge Building,science education, higher education collaborative groups, computer-supported environment,epistemic agency, collaboration, co-regulation, knowledge advancement, metacognition",; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Mixed Methods; ; ; ; [subject] science; ; [construct] agency; [construct] collaboration; [construct] epistemic agency; [construct] Epistemic Agency; [construct] metacognition,,

Drawing on Learning Sciences research on ideologies, we explore how an elementary science professional development (PD) community used substrate (shared interactional resources) in sensemaking interactions to reify or rearticulate dominant ideologies. Method: We analyzed PD interactions to understand how PD community members used substrate across multiple timescales as part of ideological sensemaking. Findings: We first show how participants drew on substrate to rearticulate ideologies about young learners’ capabilities in science. We then show how limited resources available in substrate impeded interactional engagement with deficit narratives of multilingual learners. Contribution: Practically, we demonstrate how ideological rearticulation requires establishing intentionally designed substrate as a resource for later PD and facilitation that surfaces and challenges dominant ideologies.

Students (n = 42) in a multi-year kindergarten and 1st-grade classroom participated in this study as part of their 10 regular classroom activity. The curricular unit was composed of 4 specific activity types, each of which was intended to focus students on a particular dimension of the content: (a) Inquiry with BeeSign software was intended to help students explore the benefit of individual nectar-collecting behaviors for the hive as a whole; (b) traditional drawing activities were intended to help students learn the structures of 15 the bees; (c) participatory representation activities, in which students enacted the behavior of the bees as they collect nectar, were intended to help students link bee structures to individual behaviors; and (d) an embodied nectar-gathering game was intended to help the students recognize the challenges of finding nectar for individual bees.

122,Prompting Middle School Science Students for Productive Reflection: Generic and Directed Prompts,Davis,2003,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This classroom study, involving 178 middle school science students, investigates ways of prompting students for reflection. Reflection refers to both metacognition and sense-making. The primary research question is ""Do students merely need to be prompted to reflect, or do they need guidance in reflecting productively?"" Two types of reflection prompts are contrasted. The first type, called generic prompts, represents a view that asking students to ""stop and think"" will encourage reflection. The second type, called directed prompts, assumes that a generic request for reflection is insufficient, and that students should instead be provided with hints indicating potentially productive directions for their reflection. (Students in both conditions received identical activity prompts that helped them complete the project.) The results show that students in the generic prompt condition develop more coherent understandings as they work on a complex science project. Students reflect unproductively more often in response to directed prompts as compared to the generic prompts. These poor reflectors are less successful on the project than are other better reflectors. Students with some autonomy who received generic prompts develop more coherent understandings than do their similarly autonomous peers who receive directed prompts. The role of reflection in promoting multiple, complementary knowledge integration processes is described. The article concludes with a discussion of implications for both instruction and cognition, including strategies for promoting productive reflection in classroom situations.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1201_4,[theory] Metacognitive Theory; [theory] Self-Explanation Theory,[method] coding and categorization; [method] experimental design; [method] qualitative coding; [method] surveys,[pedagogy] Reflective Practice,,,[subject] science,,[construct] learning motivation; [construct] metacognition; [construct] reflection,"Metacognitive Theory, Self-Explanation Theory,experimental design, surveys, qualitative coding,Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL), Reflective Practice,science, middle school classrooms,reflection, metacognition, learning motivation",[theory] Metacognitive Theory; [theory] Self-Explanation Theory; [method] coding and categorization; [method] experimental design; [method] qualitative coding; [method] surveys; [pedagogy] Reflective Practice; ; ; [subject] science; ; [construct] learning motivation; [construct] metacognition; [construct] reflection,,
123,Experts’ adaptation of apt epistemic performance: The role of practical knowledge,Deekens et al.,2024,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Today’s complex information environment requires effective navigation and analysis of multiple sources to make reliable decisions about complex topics. Learners must enact thinking that reliably leads to well-justified decisions, adapt thinking to specific problems and contexts, and recognize the limits of their existing knowledge (i.e. demonstrate fully apt epistemic performance). Experts can enact such performance in their own discipline but questions of whether and how they adapt that expertise to other disciplines remain. More research is needed regarding whether and how experts adapt disciplinary knowledge to tasks for which they have practical knowledge. Methods: We used inductive coding to analyze think-aloud data gathered from professors from a variety of disciplines (i.e. education, social sciences, and natural sciences) as they read and responded to a flipped classroom pedagogy scenario. Findings: Education experts demonstrated fully apt epistemic performance and more nuanced conclusions than other participants. The social and natural scientists successfully adapted their epistemic performance grounded in practical knowledge, particularly about statistics and higher education careers, to their analysis of the scenario. However, natural scientists overgeneralized their research methods knowledge, demonstrating lower epistemic meta-competence. Contribution: Our findings suggest ways in which practical knowledge supports or hinders adaptation of epistemic performance.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2024.2338937,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,

The interpersonal and mathematical aspects of students’ interactions during groupwork in seventh grade mathematics,DeJarnette,2022,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Groupwork is a desirable activity in mathematics classrooms for the opportunity it creates for collaborative reasoning and interdependence. Correlations between group-level processes and outcomes have helped characterize the features of more successful groups, but group-level constructs can obscure how students negotiate ideas. This study investigated how students’ interactions, and the written work they produced, reflected their negotiations of authority and mathematics content during groupwork. Methods: I used techniques from systemic functional linguistics to analyze transcripts from groups of 7th-grade students during work on an open-ended mathematics task, to document connections between groups’ interpersonal processes and their mathematical products. Findings: Two groups who produced similar products did so through different processes. In one group students’ written work reflected consensus, evidenced by students’ verbal contributions. In the other group, the written product reflected two distinct lines of reasoning that were both verbalized but never integrated in conversation. Contribution: While previous studies have documented differences in interactional patterns between more and, respectively, less successful groups, this study extends that line of research by describing differences between similarly successful groups.

As participants at once bring play to life in the classroom and learn about microscopic particles, they introduce and enact distinct configurations of roles, rules, and keys that shape their moment-to-moment activity and their pathways through science inquiry. Participants’ integration of distinct roles, rules, and keys during stretches of play foster on the one hand cycles of open-ended creation, observation, and destruction, and on the other hand generation of pragmatic strategies for winning assessed through game metrics. Overall, this paper introduces a framework for tracking the collaborative instantiation of roles, rules, and keys, provides preliminary documentation of how these characteristics shape learning, and invites reflection on how to move beyond general claims about games benefiting learning.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2019.1675071,[theory] Embodied Cognition; [theory] Embodied Knowing / Embodiment; [theory] Sociomaterial Theory,[method] multimodal analysis,[pedagogy] Collaborative Learning,,,[subject] science,,[construct] collaboration; [construct] participation; [construct] play,"Embodied Cognition, Play-Based Learning Framework, Sociomaterial Theory,video-based ethnography, multimodal interaction analysis,Play-Based Inquiry, Collaborative Learning,science education, elementary collaborative inquiry setting,embodiment, roles, play, material mediation, participation",[theory] Embodied Cognition; [theory] Embodied Knowing / Embodiment; [theory] Sociomaterial Theory; [method] multimodal analysis; [pedagogy] Collaborative Learning; ; ; [subject] science; ; [construct] collaboration; [construct] participation; [construct] play,,

This study contributes to research on the social context of learning by describing how children’s peer interactions can support or hinder the pair’s problem solving on the computer. Methods: Video recordings from eight pairs of middle school students programming a computer game are used to explore how working with a partner supports or hinders the pair’s persistence in the face of challenges, what we call intrepid exploration (IE). Findings: IE thrives when partners are responsive to each other both verbally and non-verbally, and when they switch driver and navigator roles to share and build on each other’s expertise. IE is hindered when partners engage in a power struggle that results in disengagement with each other and giving up on their goal. For pair programming to result in interactions that promote persistence, both students must be willing and able to embrace their assigned roles: the navigator supporting their shared goal, and the driver responding to their navigator. Contribution: The types of interactions described in this paper provide a tool for teachers to evaluate and support productive collaboration among novice pair programmers.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2021.1939028,[theory] Social Constructivism,[method] quasi-experimental design,,[population] middle school,,,,[construct] collaboration; [construct] gender; [construct] learning outcomes,"Social Constructivism, Collaborative Learning Theory, Gender and STEM Framework,quasi-experimental design, video and log analysis,Pair Programming, Collaborative Computer Science Learning,computer science education, middle school,collaboration, exploration, gender dynamics, pair roles, learning outcomes",[theory] Social Constructivism; [method] quasi-experimental design; ; [population] middle school; ; ; ; [construct] collaboration; [construct] gender; [construct] learning outcomes,,

A study was done on how the acknowledgment rate (how often partners give feedback of having perceived, understood, and accepted partner's contributions) varies according to the media and the content of interactions. It was expected that the whiteboard would serve to draw schemata that disambiguate chat utterances. Instead, results show that the whiteboard is primarily used to represent the state of problem solving and the chat is used for grounding information created on the whiteboard. These results are interpreted in terms of persistence: More persistent information is exchanged through the more persistent medium.

129,Saving Face While Geeking Out: Video Game Testing as a Justification for Learning Computer Science,DiSalvo et al.,2014,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Why would individuals who are capable of learning opt not to? Learning is important for stability and success. It would seem rational that students in groups that are frequently underrepresented or marginalized would be motivated to learn. However, negotiation of multiple identities and self-beliefs can impact motivations to learn. For example, young African American males frequently adopt a “cool pose” in their approach to education. They maintain that they do not care and will not try to be a part of the existing educational system. To better understand these issues, we studied African American males in the Glitch Game Testers program. High school students in the Glitch program worked as paid game testers and took workshops in computer science. More than 65% of the participants went on to study computing after high school. We found that these students persisted with education and computing because they navigated around motivations to not learn by creating many different faces for their involvement with Glitch. In this article, we explore the use and design implications of face-saving tactics these young men used to “geek out” on computer programming, choose computer science for their career, and maintain their current identities with friends and families.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2014.893434,[theory] Communities of Practice; [theory] Identity Theory; [theory] Learning Trajectories Framework; [theory] Situated Learning,,[pedagogy] Communities of Practice,,[setting] informal learning,,,[construct] identity; [construct] motivation; [construct] participation,"Identity Theory, Situated Learning, Communities of Practice,ethnographic study, case analysis,Informal Learning, Situated Apprenticeship,computer science education, informal learning environments, youth learners,identity, motivation, learning trajectories, participation, cultural practice",[theory] Communities of Practice; [theory] Identity Theory; [theory] Learning Trajectories Framework; [theory] Situated Learning; ; [pedagogy] Communities of Practice; ; [setting] informal learning; ; ; [construct] identity; [construct] motivation; [construct] participation,,

This theoretical paper sought to: (1) identify key developments in technology-use during the pandemic; (2) situate current events within the Learning Sciences’ evolving conceptualizations of educational technologies; and (3) outline how these developments should reframe our thinking about educational technologies. Methods: The paper is structured along three sets of relations, intended to support analyses that go beyond determinist or instrumental depictions of educational technologies: education-technology, human-technology, and human-education. Findings: I outline three key characteristics of educational technologies’ function during the pandemic: they were central to the grammar of schooling, their use was widespread across social contexts, and was need-driven rather than innovation-driven. Contribution: Accordingly, the paper suggests reorienting existing conceptualizations of educational technologies: (i) rethinking learning—avoiding the portrayal of technologies as solutions to educational problems and examining how they reshape learning; (ii) rethinking context—attending more to how socio-cultural, political, and historical features inform technological affordances; (iii) rethinking teaching—emphasizing adults’ role in mediating the normative commitments underlying technology-use, particularly in light of the dominance of commercial platforms and tools.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2021.2008395,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,

132,How Does Technology-Enabled Active Learning Affect Undergraduate Students' Understanding of Electromagnetism Concepts?,Dori & Belcher,2005,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Educational technology supports meaningful learning and enables the presentation of spatial and dynamic images, which portray relationships among complex concepts. The Technology-Enabled Active Learning (TEAL) Project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) involves media-rich software for simulation and visualization in freshman physics carried out in a specially redesigned classroom to facilitate group interaction. These technology-based learning materials are especially useful in electromagnetism to help students conceptualize phenomena and processes. This study analyzes the effects of the unique learning environment of the TEAL project on students' cognitive and affective outcomes. The assessment of the project included examining students' conceptual understanding before and after studying electromagnetism in a media-rich environment. We also investigated the effect of this environment on students' preferences regarding the various teaching methods. As part of the project, we developed pre- and posttests consisting of conceptual questions from standardized tests, as well as questions designed to assess the effect of visualizations and experiments. The research population consisted of 811 undergraduate students. It consisted of a small- and a large-scale experimental groups and a control group. TEAL students improved their conceptual understanding of the subject matter to a significantly higher extent than their control group peers. A majority of the students in the small-scale experiment noted that they would recommend the TEAL course to fellow students, indicating the benefits of interactivity, visualization, and hands-on experiments, which the technology helped enable.

This ethos reflected three decades of prior work on the interdisciplinary study of learning; however, in the three decades since the emergence of the Learning Sciences, it seems to have largely disappeared. I begin by describing the ethos that was prevalent in 1991 using quotations from the inaugural editorial of the Journal of the Learning Sciences. I then describe how this ethos was prevalent decades before the Learning Sciences in four distinct approaches to cognitive science research, which I call the “Four C’s”—cognitivism, constructivism, cybernetics, and connectionism. I suggest three reasons why the Learning Sciences moved away from the use of artificial intelligence as a central tool for thinking about learning, noting that these reasons do not suggest a fundamental incompatibility between the two. I end by discussing how Learning Scientists might once again embrace artificial intelligence and computational modeling and use them as tools for gaining insight into the constructivist, situated, and socio-cultural nature of learning.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2023.2260159,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,

The effects of structuring novices' problem analyses in this way were assessed in three areas: (a) judgments of solution similarity, (b) reasoning about solution similarity, and (c) problem solving. Experiment 1 provides evidence that performing qualitative and hierarchically structured problem analyses leads novices to make more expertlike judgments of solution similarity. As shown in Experiment 2, this shift is due to an increased focus by novices upon the deep structure of problems. The results of Experiment 3 indicate that qualitative and hierarchically structured problem analyses can improve novices' ability to solve problems.

We created two versions of an educational game for learning policy argumentation called Policy World. The game (only) version provided minimal feedback and penalized students for errors whereas the game+tutor version provided additional step-level teaching feedback and immediate error correction. A total of 105 university students played either the game or game+tutor version of Policy World in a randomized, controlled, two-group, between-subjects experiment, during which we measured students’ problem-solving abilities, interest in the game, self-reported competence, and pre- and posttest performance. The game+tutor version increased learning of policy analysis skills and self-reported competence. A path analysis supported the claim that greater assistance helped students to learn analysis better, which increased their feelings of competence, which increased their interest in the game. Log data of student behavior showed that debate performance improved only for students who had sufficiently mastered analysis.

A total of 79 parent–child pairs with children ages 6–10 participated in a controlled study in which half of the parents used their natural conversational style and the other half were trained to use 4 conversational strategies during family observations of pollination in a botanical garden. Parents were also assigned to high- and low-knowledge groups according to their knowledge of pollination biology. Findings suggest that parents who received training used the conversational strategies more than parents who used their natural conversational style. Parents and children who knew more about pollination at the start of the study exhibited higher levels of disciplinary talk in the garden. However, the use of the conversational strategies also increased the amount of disciplinary talk in the garden. The extent to which families engaged in disciplinary talk in the garden predicted significant variance in what children learned from the experience.

For newcomers in such communities, the learning process can be described as legitimate peripheral participation (LPP). Although a body of knowledge on LPP has been accumulated from qualitative case studies, mostly focusing on the use of practices, the concrete mechanisms that shape the LPP process have not yet been systematically analyzed. In this study, we examined participation support structures with a focus on activities that senior CoP members demonstrate to foster newcomers’ participation. The use of 8 distinct participation support structures was identified in interviews with experienced members of faculty student councils. A hierarchical linear model based on data from 68 newcomers in 14 faculty student councils was computed. The model showed that in addition to exposure time and CoP size, 2 participation support structures (recruitment strategies and accessibility of community knowledge) were predictive of the newcomers’ level of participation. We conclude that senior members’ specific participation support structures can facilitate or hinder newcomers’ participation in CoPs and that the original LPP approach needs to be enhanced by taking participation support structures into account.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2014.883978,[theory] Apprenticeship Learning; [theory] Communities of Practice; [theory] Social Constructivism,[method] Collaborative Design Research; [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [method] Mixed Methods; [theory] Interaction Analysis,,,,,,[construct] collaboration; [construct] community; [construct] participation,"Communities of Practice (CoP), Legitimate Peripheral Participation (LPP), Social Constructivism,mixed methods, interaction analysis,Apprenticeship Learning, Collaborative Design,design education, professional training environments,participation, mentoring, community, expertise development, collaboration",[theory] Apprenticeship Learning; [theory] Communities of Practice; [theory] Social Constructivism; [method] Collaborative Design Research; [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [method] Mixed Methods; [theory] Interaction Analysis; ; ; ; ; ; [construct] collaboration; [construct] community; [construct] participation,,

However, the implementation of inquiry learning in classrooms presents a number of significant challenges. We have been exploring these challenges through a program of research on the use of scientific visualization technologies to support inquiry-based learning in the geosciences. In this article, we describe 5 significant challenges to implementing inquiry-based learning and present strategies for addressing them through the design of technology and curriculum.

140,The temporal dimension of teacher learning in a video-based professional development program: An ecological perspective,Ehrenfeld & Stengel,2025,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Attending and responding to when and where teachers are with respect to change—the temporal aspects of teacher learning—can yield more effective professional development (PD) efforts. Toward this end, we conceptualize phases of learning in a PD program, and how these phases are shaped by teacher learning ecologies. Methods: Conceptually, we build on the Adaptive Cycles framework (Gunderson & Holling, 2002) to represent this complexity, and empirically, we build on video-based PD conversations. Using interaction analysis methods, we ground our model by investigating learning in the PD through the phases of the Adaptive Cycles. Findings: We offer a way of capturing complexity while still enabling analysis. Empirical investigation shows how the teams differed in their starting point, learning experiences, and available resources. We distinguish phases in which video-based reflection was more salient in honing teachers’ pedagogical judgments, and phases through which invoking the variety of resources was more significant. Contribution: These findings provide tools for centering temporality and bringing it, in a more substantive way, into consideration in design, facilitation, and analysis of teacher PD, toward enhanced responsiveness of PD providers to the rhythms of teacher learning and the teachers’ experiences of this learning.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2025.2468205,[theory] Adaptive Cycles Framework; [theory] Ecological Perspective,[method] Ecological Perspective; [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [theory] Interaction Analysis,[pedagogy] Reflective Practice,,[setting] teacher education; [setting] teacher professional development,,,[construct] reflection,",Adaptive Cycles framework,ecological perspective,,,interaction analysis,video analysis,professional development,conceptual modeling,,,,teacher education,professional development,science teaching,,,temporality,teacher education ecologies,pedagogical judgment,reflective practice,",[theory] Adaptive Cycles Framework; [theory] Ecological Perspective; [method] Ecological Perspective; [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [theory] Interaction Analysis; [pedagogy] Reflective Practice; ; [setting] teacher education; [setting] teacher professional development; ; ; [construct] reflection,,

146,Defining Personal Epistemology: A Response to Hofer &amp; Pintrich (1997) and Sandoval (2005),Elby,2009,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Some researchers, including CitationB. K. Hofer and P. R. Pintrich (1997) and W. A. CitationSandoval (2005), argue for defining personal epistemology as views about the nature of knowledge and knowing but not views about the nature of learning. Others continue using a more expansive definition of personal epistemology that includes views about learning. I argue that the scope of personal epistemology should not be decided entirely a priori. If people's views about the nature of knowing and knowledge turn out to be separable from (despite being intertwined with) their views about the nature of learning, then it makes sense to define 2 separate areas of study corresponding to those 2 separable sets of psychological constructs. From some theoretical perspectives, however, empirical results may support the interpretation that views about knowledge are inseparably entangled with views about learning. In that case, excluding views about learning from personal epistemology obscures rather than elucidates the content and cognitive structure of students' views. To be clear, I do not think the community should decide, now, to etch “views about the nature of learning” into the definition of personal epistemology. I argue instead that it is more productive not to converge on a definition until further empirical and theoretical progress points us toward the best way to “cut up [nature] … along its natural joints” (CitationPlato, 1995, p. 64).",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400802581684,[theory] Epistemic Cognition; [theory] Epistemology,[method] conceptual modeling,,,,,,[construct] belief; [construct] epistemic beliefs; [construct] epistemic cognition; [construct] epistemology; [construct] knowledge,"Epistemic Cognition, Personal Epistemology, Constructivist Theory,conceptual analysis,—,theoretical discourse, science and philosophy of education,epistemology, belief, cognition, justification, knowledge construction",[theory] Epistemic Cognition; [theory] Epistemology; [method] conceptual modeling; ; ; ; ; ; [construct] belief; [construct] epistemic beliefs; [construct] epistemic cognition; [construct] epistemology; [construct] knowledge,,
147,A Taxonomy for Categorizing Generalizations: Generalizing Actions and Reflection Generalizations,Ellis,2007,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article presents a cohesive, empirically grounded categorization system differentiating the types of generalizations students constructed when reasoning mathematically. The generalization taxonomy developed out of an empirical study conducted during a 3-week teaching experiment and a series of individual interviews. Qualitative analysis of data from teaching sessions with 7 seventh-graders and individual interviews with 7 eighth-graders resulted in a taxonomy that distinguishes between students' activity as they generalize, or generalizing actions, and students' final statements of generalization, or reflection generalizations. The three major generalizing action categories that emerged from analysis are (a) relating, in which one forms an association between two or more problems or objects, (b) searching, in which one repeats an action to locate an element of similarity, and (c) extending, in which one expands a pattern or relation into a more general structure. Reflection generalizations took the form of identifications or statements, definitions, and the influence of prior ideas or strategies. By locating generalization within the learner's viewpoint, the taxonomy moves beyond casting it as an activity at which students either fail or succeed to allow researchers to identify what students see as general, and how they engage in the act of generalizing.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400701193705,[theory] Cognitive Development,[method] Qualitative Inquiry,,,,[subject] mathematics,,[construct] reflection,"Mathematical Reasoning Theory, Cognitive Development,qualitative analysis, task-based interviews,Inquiry-Based Mathematics Education,mathematics, middle school classrooms,generalization, reasoning, reflection, abstraction, pattern recognition",[theory] Cognitive Development; [method] Qualitative Inquiry; ; ; ; [subject] mathematics; ; [construct] reflection,,

We studied entrepreneurship education as an example of new epistemic activity which opens institutional boundaries for active engagement with society in learning. Methods: We used a case-study strategy and a methodology informed by the cultural-historical activity theory for investigating an entrepreneurship course of a middle school. We focused on meaning making in object formation of learning of the groups involved in boundary crossing. Meaning making was studied in a context-sensitive way with an analytic tool designed in the study. FIndings: Lacking a knowledge system of a disciplinary school subject, the findings show that entrepreneurship becomes constructed in practice epistemologically as a value-free and politically neutral learning object. In light of these findings we discuss the theoretical link between conceptual learning and learning around real-world phenomena. Contribution: In addition to economic activity, globalization and climate change are also presently forming the social realities of school learners. Our study shows that more theoretical and empirical research on intermediate epistemological practices is needed to avoid a risk that teachers are left on their own to sort out the complex epistemic interrelationships.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2021.1908296,[theory] (Cultural-Historical) Activity Theory (CHAT); [theory] Expansive Learning,[method] Activity System Analysis; [method] Case Study Research,[pedagogy] Phenomenon-Based Learning,,,,,[construct] meaning making; [construct] participation,"Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT), Boundary Crossing Framework, Phenomenon-Based Learning,case study, activity system analysis,Entrepreneurship Education, Boundary-Crossing Pedagogy,entrepreneurship education, middle school and community collaboration,object formation, boundary crossing, epistemic activity, meaning making, social participation",[theory] (Cultural-Historical) Activity Theory (CHAT); [theory] Expansive Learning; [method] Activity System Analysis; [method] Case Study Research; [pedagogy] Phenomenon-Based Learning; ; ; ; ; [construct] meaning making; [construct] participation,,
150,Framing Interactions to Foster Generative Learning: A Situative Explanation of Transfer in a Community of Learners Classroom,Engle,2006,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article develops a situative approach to explaining the transfer of learning, illustrating it using a challenging-to-explain case from a Fostering Communities of Learners classroom. The case involved a group of 5th graders who learned and then transferred a more sophisticated way of explaining species survival and endangerment despite participating in a unit in which many activities designed to foster transfer were short circuited. The explanation included 2 kinds of analyses: (a) how students participated in the learning of relevant content, and (b) how learning contexts were framed interactionally. The content analysis took a situative perspective on commonly investigated transfer mechanisms such as quality of initial learning, engagement with multiple examples, comparison between examples, and formation of generalizations. There was strong evidence for a few of these mechanisms and weak or inconclusive evidence for others. The context analysis explored 2 aspects of the relatively new hypothesis that transfer is more likely to occur when learning contexts are framed as part of a larger ongoing intellectual conversation in which students are actively involved. First, the analysis showed that the teacher worked to frame learning contexts as being temporally connected with other contexts in which the students could use what they were learning. Second, it showed that the teacher worked to frame the students as contributing members of a larger community of people interested in what they were learning about. These and other forms of framing may have encouraged the students to expect that they would be generatively using what they were learning, thus leading them to make better use of the content-based supports for transfer that were available. Thus, this study suggests that coordinating analyses of content with the framing of contexts may be a particularly fruitful approach for developing more comprehensive explanations of how and why the transfer of learning occurs.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls1504_2,[theory] Situative Perspective; [theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [method] participant observation,[pedagogy] Collaborative Learning; [pedagogy] Community of Learners,,,[subject] science,,[construct] accountability; [construct] collaboration; [construct] community; [construct] participation; [construct] transfer,"Situative Perspective, Sociocultural Theory, Framing Theory,video analysis, discourse analysis, ethnographic observation,Community of Learners, Collaborative Learning,science education, middle school classrooms,transfer, framing, participation, generative learning, accountability",[theory] Situative Perspective; [theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [method] participant observation; [pedagogy] Collaborative Learning; [pedagogy] Community of Learners; ; ; [subject] science; ; [construct] accountability; [construct] collaboration; [construct] community; [construct] participation; [construct] transfer,,

We propose a 5-component theoretical framework in order to explain how undue influence unfolds. We build on literatures on persuasion, argumentation, discourse, and classroom discussions to develop a framework that models how each participant’s level of influence in a discussion emerges out of the social negotiation of influence itself and the following 4 components that interact with it: (a) the negotiated merit of each participant’s contributions; and each participant’s (b) degree of intellectual authority, (c) access to the conversational floor, and (d) degree of spatial privilege. We then illustrate how the framework works by explaining how 1 student became unduly influential during a heated, student-led scientific debate. Finally, we close by outlining how our framework can be further developed to better understand and address differences in influence in classrooms and other learning contexts.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2014.883979,[theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA),,,,,,[construct] discourse; [construct] equity; [construct] participation,"Sociocultural Theory, Positioning Theory, Argumentation Framework,discourse analysis, microethnographic study,Collaborative Argumentation,small-group learning, secondary education,influence, authority, participation, discourse, equity",[theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); ; ; ; ; ; [construct] discourse; [construct] equity; [construct] participation,,

In designing the Community Mapping Project, we attempted to create conditions under which urban students themselves would come to recognize how mathematics is relevant to their lives and their communities. Using mixed methods, we analyzed the pre- and postassessments and final projects of 25 high school students to investigate what students learned from their experience. We also analyzed the data from video case studies to begin to understand how learning was organized. Our qualitative analysis revealed several tensions that emerged between the goals and norms of our instantiation of a culturally relevant pedagogy and the goals and norms of our mathematics pedagogy. We argue that how these tensions are navigated mediate what opportunity students have for learning statistics.

I examined how the interplay between 2 social configurations-local investigations at a computer simulation and whole-class discussions-contributes to how 7th-grade students learn probabilistic reasoning. I used 2 case studies to investigate (a) how different forms of participation are linked to different social configurations, and (b) how specific discourse practices and ways of reasoning propagate across the classroom and are adopted by individual students. The analyses suggest that classroom mathematical practices are developed, in part, for the social or communicative purpose of settling disputes and not purely for their rational or cognitive value to individuals. Results also provide insight into how to design and orchestrate classroom practice, particularly computer-mediated inquiry, to foster individual learning that is situated within a classroom community oriented toward the construction of a shared understanding of probability.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1203_2,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,

People's ability to learn to perform well on such tasks is therefore a clear indication that not all situations are equally relevant to learning. The primary contributions of this article are the notion of key nodes, situations particularly important to the development of expertise, the presentation of empirical evidence for their existence, and the design of a training method intended to capitalize on them. This article suggests why key nodes may be clustered in the search space and describes how a learner may arrive at a key node by chance, be drawn there by a choice the learner makes or be driven there by the actions of another agent. This article offers empirical evidence of substantial improvement in the quality of performance when a game-learning program is deliberately directed to clusters of key nodes, and considers several ways to do so. It also discusses the extension of these results to other domains and speculates on the significance of the results for human learners.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0403_2,[theory] Distributed Cognition; [theory] Ecological Psychology; [theory] Situated Cognition; [theory] Situated Learning,[method] conceptual modeling,,,,,,[construct] distributed cognition; [construct] transfer,",situated learning,ecological psychology,distributed cognition,,,theoretical synthesis,conceptual analysis,,,,workplace learning,everyday cognition,,,context-dependent learning,affordances,learning transfer,situated cognition,",[theory] Distributed Cognition; [theory] Ecological Psychology; [theory] Situated Cognition; [theory] Situated Learning; [method] conceptual modeling; ; ; ; ; ; [construct] distributed cognition; [construct] transfer,,
156,"Waldo, blind inquirers, and an elephant: Locating learning in social movements",Erickson,2021,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This special issue introduces a new focus for inquiry in the learning sciences. When research attention turns to learning that takes place within social movements, the scope and scale of inquiry expands dramatically. It becomes difficult to see learning, as we usually conceive it. The author’s commentary begins with two metaphors for difficulty in this new arena of research. A first metaphor is that of “Waldo,” a cartoon figure visually represented as located somewhere within crowds of persons that are similarly dressed. This illustrates the problem of scale in the study of social movements, in attempts to monitor activity that is widely dispersed in space and time. A second metaphor is that of blind inquirers attempting to study an elephant—each inquirer only gets a partial apprehension of the whole. This points to the multiplicity of opportunities to learn within social movements—raising awareness in social critique, acquiring skills in organizing, developing fluency in rhetorics of persuasion. Because movement-situated learning is so multidimensional it is difficult for a single study to account for the full range of learning opportunities that a movement affords. In its middle section the commentary surveys specific examples of limits and affordances in research on learning in social movements, by reviewing briefly the empirical studies reported in the journal articles and by recounting the author’s personal experience in the Civil Rights movement in Chicago in the 1960’s. The commentary concludes on a cautionary note, observing that many of the processes of social movement formation, and of learning opportunities that develop within such movements, are similar in movements that are regressive as well as in those that are progressive in aim.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2021.1880190,[theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] COMMENTARY,[pedagogy] Critical Reflective Practice,,,,,[construct] critical reflection; [construct] critical thinking; [construct] participation,"Sociocultural Theory, Social Movement Learning Framework,theoretical commentary, reflective synthesis,Movement-Based Learning, Critical Reflection,civic and activist learning, social movement contexts,scale of learning, participation, critique, distributed practice, learning opportunities",[theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] COMMENTARY; [pedagogy] Critical Reflective Practice; ; ; ; ; [construct] critical reflection; [construct] critical thinking; [construct] participation,,

The labs provide an environment for cognitive apprenticeship enhanced by formative assessment. As a result, students develop interpretive knowing that helps them approach new problems as scientists. This article describes a classroom study in which the students in the ISLE design lab performed equally well on traditional exams as ISLE students who did not engage in design activities. However, the design group significantly outperformed the non-design group while working on novel experimental tasks (in physics and biology), demonstrating the application of scientific abilities to an inquiry task in a novel content domain. This research shows that a learning environment that integrates cognitive apprenticeship and formative assessment in a series of conceptual design tasks provides a rich context for helping students build scientific habits of mind.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400903452876,,[method] Mixed Methods; [method] quasi-experimental design,[pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Science Education (IBSE); [pedagogy] Reflective Practice,[population] undergraduates,,[subject] physics,,[construct] learning outcomes; [construct] reflection,"Reflective Practice Theory, Inquiry-Based Science Education, Design Experimentation Theory,quasi-experimental design, mixed methods, student work analysis,Inquiry-Based Laboratory Learning, Reflective Practice,physics education, undergraduate laboratory, college students,scientific abilities, reflection, inquiry, design, learning outcomes",; [method] Mixed Methods; [method] quasi-experimental design; [pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Science Education (IBSE); [pedagogy] Reflective Practice; [population] undergraduates; ; [subject] physics; ; [construct] learning outcomes; [construct] reflection,,
160,Does Instructional Approach Matter? How Elaboration Plays a Crucial Role in Multimedia Learning,Eysink & Jong,2012,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This study compared the affordances of 4 multimedia learning environments for specific learning processes. The environments covered the same domain but used different instructional approaches: (a) hypermedia learning, (b) observational learning, (c) self-explanation-based learning, and (d) inquiry learning. Although they all promote an active attitude, they differ in the specific learning processes they intend to foster. In earlier research (Eysink et al., 2009), we found that learners involved in self-explanation-based or inquiry learning had the highest learning outcomes. In these approaches learners were required to generate (parts of) the subject matter, from which we concluded that they presumably stimulated learners to elaborate. Therefore, in the present study we expected that learners involved in self-explanation-based or inquiry learning would engage in more learning processes connected to elaboration than would learners involved in hypermedia or observational learning. Forty participants worked through the learning environments while thinking aloud; their protocols were coded using a generic learning processes scheme. Results showed that self-explanation-based learning and inquiry learning led to greater engagement in learning processes in general and more elaborative processes in particular. The results suggest that elaboration is indeed the key process explaining differences in learning across different instructional approaches within multimedia learning environments.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2011.611776,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,
161,Change Blindness as a Means of Studying Expertise in Physics,Feil & Mestre,2010,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Previous studies examining expertise have used a wide range of methods. Beyond characterizing expert and novice behavior in different contexts and circumstances, many studies have examined the processes that comprise the behavior itself and, more recently, processes that comprise training and practice that develop expertise. Other studies, dating back more than 50 years, have used various recall memory tasks to compare experts and novices. In this article, we describe another method for investigating expertise that has its origin in the study of change blindness, a phenomenon within the field of visual cognition. We demonstrate how an incidental change detection paradigm can be used in the context of introductory physics in a way that allows for inferences regarding the formation of mental representations about physical situations.

162,ASK Systems: An Approach to the Realization of Story-Based Teachers,Ferguson et al.,1992,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Telling stories is an effective way to teach aspects of nearly every task and domain. However, to be effectively remembered, a story must be told in a context that enables the hearer to index it functionally in memory. This occurs naturally when stories are told to students while they are attempting to perform the task being taught. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to engage students in a task while teaching it, so some other context must be found that facilitates appropriate indexing. We argue that this context occurs naturally in a teaching dialog, called an Aesopic dialog, in which the student asks questions and the expert answers with stories. In this dialog, the coherence of the conversation itself provides a context that enables the stories to be usefully incorporated into the student's memory. The widespread application of teaching through Aesopic dialogs requires overcoming the hurdle that experts are scarce and access to them is limited. Our solution to this problem is to broaden access to expert stories through the development of hypermedia systems designed to provide an interaction that emulates, as much as possible, the cognitively relevant aspects of an Aesopic dialog with an expert. We have constructed a number of such story-based teachers, called ASK systems, in domains as diverse as trust bank consulting, Presidential decision-making, and the determinants of a nation's industrial success in global markets.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0201_3,[theory] Cognitive Modeling,[method] Cognitive Modeling; [method] computational modeling,[pedagogy] Case-Based Learning (CBL); [pedagogy] Case-Based Reasoning; [pedagogy] Intelligent Tutoring Systems; [theory] Case-Based Instruction; [theory] Case-Based Reasoning,,,,[technology] computer-based instruction; [technology] intelligent tutoring systems; [technology] simulations,[construct] knowledge; [construct] narrative,",tech: artificial intelligence in education,case-based reasoning,story-based learning,,,system design,cognitive modeling,simulation,,,,intelligent tutoring systems,computer-based learning,,,narrative reasoning,knowledge representation,tutoring dialogue,instructional design,",[theory] Cognitive Modeling; [method] Cognitive Modeling; [method] computational modeling; [pedagogy] Case-Based Learning (CBL); [pedagogy] Case-Based Reasoning; [pedagogy] Intelligent Tutoring Systems; [theory] Case-Based Instruction; [theory] Case-Based Reasoning; ; ; ; [technology] computer-based instruction; [technology] intelligent tutoring systems; [technology] simulations; [construct] knowledge; [construct] narrative,,
163,Learning Mathematics From Classroom Instruction: On Relating Lessons to Pupils' Interpretations,Fernandez et al.,1992,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"How do students learn mathematics from classroom instruction? We propose a framework in which we assume that a student must form a coherent mental representation of the events that take place in a lesson and then use this representation to construct new knowledge. The process of representing the events of a lesson as a coherent whole is assumed to be affected by characteristics of the lesson (e.g., the clarity with which goals are expressed), as well as by characteristics of the student trying to learn from the lesson (e.g., background knowledge, lesson schemas). This framework is applied (a) by assessing both the nature of the mental representations students form of lessons and what they have learned from the instruction and relating the two, (b) by manipulating the way a lesson is taught and seeing how this affects how it is represented, and (c) by seeing how students who differ in various ways represent the same lesson.

In addition, the study explores the extent to which learners share knowledge with respect to individual outcomes under these different conditions. The study also analyzes the relation between the use of knowledge resources and different types of knowledge. The type of external representation (content specific vs. content independent) and the collaboration condition (videoconferencing vs. face to face) were varied. Sixty-four university students participated in the study. Results showed that learning partners converged strongly with respect to their use of resources during the collaboration process. Convergence with respect to outcomes was rather low, but relatively higher for application-oriented knowledge than for factual knowledge. With content-specific external representation, learners used more appropriate knowledge resources without sharing more knowledge after collaboration. Learners in the computer-mediated collaboration used a wider range of resources. Moreover, in exploratory qualitative and quantitative analyses, the study found evidence for a relation between aspects of the collaborative process and knowledge convergence.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls1403_3,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,
166,Orchestrating the Multiple Voices and Inscriptions of a Mathematics Classroom,Forman & Ansell,2002,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The purpose of this article is to explore how inscriptions are used to create argumentative positions in the 2 classroom episodes, Batteries and AIDS. This activity is similar to a prominent practice of scientific communities: the use of inscriptions to advance knowledge claims. We begin by discussing the meaning and function of inscriptions in scientific communities and then apply some notions from the history and sociology of science to our analyses of the case study data in the 2 episodes. In addition, we address some of the challenges for teachers in incorporating scientific practices into their classroom activities. Among these challenges is the need to alter the nature of the problems and inscriptions used as well as change classroom discourse structures. In our analyses of the 2 episodes, we found that the classroom activities resembled those of scientific communities in several ways: Real-world, dilemma-driven problems were presented; students evaluated the inscriptions offered in terms of their adequacy for advancing particular knowledge claims; and the teachers helped their students reflect on, clarify, expand, evaluate, oppose, or integrate each other's explanations into their argumentative positions. We also found that the teachers legitimated student contributions to the discussion by revoicing their arguments. Despite the positive findings from our analyses, we were able to identify and illustrate one additional challenge for future design experiments: How do we orchestrate the multiple voices of the classroom in an equitable fashion while pursuing our instructional goals?",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2002.9672139,[theory] Argumentation Theory; [theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] Case Study Research; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA),,[population] middle school,,[subject] mathematics,,[construct] argumentation,",sociocultural theory,argumentation,discourse analysis,,,case study,classroom discourse analysis,,,,middle school,mathematics education,,,inscriptions,argumentation,revoicing,teacher orchestration,student participation,",[theory] Argumentation Theory; [theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] Case Study Research; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); ; [population] middle school; ; [subject] mathematics; ; [construct] argumentation,,

168,When discussions sputter or take flight: Comparing productive disciplinary engagement in two history classes,Freedman,2020,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Despite its numerous benefits, dialogic discussion seldom occurs in secondary history classrooms. To examine ways to promote it, this study compared two ninth-grade classes’ productive disciplinary engagement (PDE) in a whole-class discussion on the Gulf of Tonkin incident. Methods: The two class sections were comparable academically but had experienced slightly different implementations of the curriculum. Analytic codes tracked discursive moves within each discussion (e.g., authentic questioning), as well as shifts in discursive style (e.g., from monologic to dialogic). Findings: Analysis suggests that both classes employed sound historical reasoning throughout, but that the third-period class grew more productively engaged. The disparity traces back to the days spent preparing students for discussion, which in third period served to construct a more compelling problem to explore, and to position students as more knowledgeable authorities. Yet even in that class, student dialogue emerged late in the discussion, after segments devoted to establishing textual evidence and answering student questions. Contribution: Based on these findings, a model is presented for promoting PDE in historical discussions that emphasizes the distribution of intellectual authority and the provision of sufficient time and resources.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2020.1744442,,[method] participant observation,,,[setting] classrooms,,,[construct] agency; [construct] epistemic agency; [construct] Epistemic Agency,"Productive Disciplinary Engagement (Engle & Conant, 2002), Dialogic Teaching Framework,comparative discourse analysis, classroom observation,Discussion-Based Historical Inquiry, Dialogic Instruction,history education, high school classrooms,disciplinary engagement, dialogic discussion, authority distribution, student questioning, epistemic agency",; [method] participant observation; ; ; [setting] classrooms; ; ; [construct] agency; [construct] epistemic agency; [construct] Epistemic Agency,,

Employing a sociocultural and interactional approach, this article illuminates how student resources become mediational means in ways that support learning. Methods: The empirical basis constitutes whole-class conversations involving lower secondary school students and their teacher during a science project about genetics. The applied analytical procedure involves microanalyses of sequences of student–teacher interaction in settings where students invoke resources from their everyday lives. Findings: The findings demonstrate that student resources became mediational means that (a) enabled students to express and test out their conceptual understanding and scientific reasoning, (b) promoted student participation and curiosity, and (c) positioned students as authoritative and accountable participants in whole-class conversations. Furthermore, how student resources became mediational means was also dependent on the distribution of authoritative roles between students and the teacher.

These changes were also observed in the Uttarakhand Himalayan region, where the need for a comprehensive understanding of land use land cover (LULC) dynamics, alongside climatic variables such as temperature and precipitation trends, is critical. This study utilizes high-resolution ESRI Sentinel-2 Land Cover Explorer imagery at a 10-meter resolution to analyze LULCC across the basin for 2017-2023. These changes are vital in influencing water availability, the growth of evergreen forests, and snow cover. The temporal analysis reveals significant shifts in LULC patterns from 2017 to 2023, primarily driven by variations in precipitation rather than temperature. Overall, from 2017 to 2023, water bodies have decreased by 92.74 hectares, evergreen forest has increased by 601.03 hectares, and snow cover has increased by 12,669.59 hectares. The accuracy of land use Land cover was evaluated by using the quantitative accuracy determination index (QADI), which demonstrates an overall accuracy of more than 92.81%.

The project aimed to foster a meaningful context for identity development, learning, and spacemaking as intertwined relational processes. Methods: Using critical ethnography, this study documents key activities and moments where students leveraged their spatial knowledge and relationships to design for their own communities. In positioning the Black neighborhoods as a Figured World, ethnographic observations and analysis focus on how students engaged with the histories and present-day realities of their relations to these neighborhoods during the design process. Findings: Data highlights how students’ design work cultivated their sense of identity-in-place and spatial storylines. Youth utilized design as a mode of resistance to gentrification and displacement. Findings reveal how students took on roles as both designers and storytellers to embed their personal and collective histories into architectural practice.

175,Investigating the Potential of Guided Practice With an Enactment Tool for Supporting Adaptive Performance,Ghousseini et al.,2015,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Recently, attention has focused on identifying core instructional practices that could leverage novice teachers’ development of professional knowledge and skill. To help novices learn to implement these practices, there is also increasing interest in developing enactment tools that could translate abstract conceptual tasks into more concrete steps. Less attention, however, has been paid to understanding how novices might learn to use these tools adaptively in the context of practice. We address this issue by integrating a set of theoretical considerations that together serve as a model for investigating how novices could learn within a community of practice to use a specified elicitation sequence adaptively, guided by more experienced members in that community. In our results, we provide thematic categories for the problems that arose as novices used the sequence of questions and demonstrate how these problems afforded the teacher educator opportunities to connect novices’ work to a set of professional commitments that could guide their adaptive practice. In particular, we highlight how these opportunities arose in the midst of modifying the question sequence and investigating the consequences of its enactment. Although our analysis focuses on a particular question sequence, we see our results as relevant to the development of other forms of enactment tools for use in adaptive practice across a range of professional domains.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2015.1057339,[theory] Cognitive Apprenticeship,[method] participant observation,[pedagogy] Cognitive Apprenticeship; [pedagogy] Simulation-Based Learning,,[setting] classrooms; [setting] teacher education,,[technology] simulations,[construct] adaptive expertise; [construct] feedback; [construct] reflection,"Adaptive Expertise Framework, Cognitive Apprenticeship, Teacher Learning Theory,design-based experiment, classroom observation,Guided Practice, Simulation-Based Learning,teacher education, teacher professional development workshops,adaptive expertise, reflection, enactment, feedback, practice",[theory] Cognitive Apprenticeship; [method] participant observation; [pedagogy] Cognitive Apprenticeship; [pedagogy] Simulation-Based Learning; ; [setting] classrooms; [setting] teacher education; ; [technology] simulations; [construct] adaptive expertise; [construct] feedback; [construct] reflection,,
176,Using Concept Maps to Facilitate Collaborative Simulation-Based Inquiry Learning,Gijlers & Jong,2013,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This study investigates the effect of a shared concept-mapping task on high school students' learning about kinematics in a collaborative simulation-based inquiry setting. Pairs of students were randomly assigned to a concept-mapping condition (12 pairs) or a control condition (13 pairs). Students in the concept-mapping condition had a computer-supported collaborative concept-mapping tool that aimed to integrate concepts and propositions. Students in the control condition used the same learning environment without the concept-mapping tool. Students' interactions with each other and with the simulation were tracked by log files. Learning was assessed with tests of intuitive and structural knowledge and a proposition test. Students in the concept-mapping condition exchanged significantly more chat messages related to experimentation, interpretation, and drawing conclusions and were more engaged in integration-oriented consensus building, which regression analysis showed to be positively related to learning gains for both intuitive and structural knowledge. Students in the concept-mapping condition outperformed their peers on the intuitive and structural knowledge tests. These results suggest that concept maps can positively influence consensus-building activities and learning in a collaborative inquiry-learning setting.

In our approach, we use a 2-step process: First we use text replay tagging, a type of rapid protocol analysis in which categories are developed and, in turn, used to hand-score students' log data. In the second step, educational data mining is conducted using a combination of the text replay data and machine-distilled features of student interactions in order to produce an automated means of assessing the inquiry skill in question; this is referred to as a detector. Once this detector is appropriately validated, it can be applied to students' log files for auto-assessment and, in the future, to drive scaffolding in real time.

182,Promoting Transfer by Grounding Complex Systems Principles,Goldstone & Wilensky,2008,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Understanding scientific phenomena in terms of complex systems principles is both scientifically and pedagogically important. Situations from different disciplines of science are often governed by the same principle, and so promoting knowledge transfer across disciplines makes valuable cross-fertilization and scientific unification possible. Although evidence for this kind of transfer has historically been controversial, experiments and observations of students suggest pedagogical methods for promoting transfer of complex systems principles. One powerful strategy is for students to actively interpret the elements and interactions of perceptually grounded scenarios. Such interpretation can be facilitated through the presentation of a situation alongside a description of how the agents in the situation are behaving, and by students exploring and constructing computational models of the situation. The resulting knowledge can be both concretely grounded yet highly perspective dependent and generalizeable. We discuss methods for coordinating computational and mental models of complex systems, the roles of idealization and concreteness in fostering understanding and generalization, and other complementary theoretical approaches to achieving transfer.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400802394898,[theory] Complex Systems Theory; [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Embodied Knowing / Embodiment; [theory] Situated Cognition; [theory] Systems Theory,[method] computational modeling; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR),[pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR),,,,[technology] computational modeling; [technology] simulations,[construct] representations; [construct] systems thinking; [construct] transfer,"Complex Systems Theory, Situated Cognition, Computational Modeling,design-based research, simulation study,Modeling-Based Learning, Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL),science and mathematics, high school and undergraduate classrooms, simulations,transfer, systems thinking, abstraction, embodiment, representation",[theory] Complex Systems Theory; [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Embodied Knowing / Embodiment; [theory] Situated Cognition; [theory] Systems Theory; [method] computational modeling; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); ; ; ; [technology] computational modeling; [technology] simulations; [construct] representations; [construct] systems thinking; [construct] transfer,,
180,The Transfer of Scientific Principles Using Concrete and Idealized Simulations,Goldstone & Son,2005,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Participants in 2 experiments interacted with computer simulations designed to foster understanding of scientific principles governing complex adaptive systems. The quality of participants' transportable understanding was measured by the amount of transfer between 2 simulations governed by the same principle. The perceptual concreteness of the elements within the first simulation was manipulated. The elements either remained concrete throughout the simulation, remained idealized, or switched midway into the simulation from concrete to idealized or vice versa. Transfer was better when the appearance of the elements switched, consistent with theories predicting more general schemas when the schemas are multiply instantiated. The best transfer was observed when originally concrete elements became idealized. These results are interpreted in terms of tradeoffs between grounded, concrete construals of simulations and more abstract, transportable construals. Progressive idealization (""concreteness fading"") allows originally grounded and interpretable principles to become less tied to specific contexts and hence more transferable.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls1401_4,[theory] Cognitive Psychology; [theory] Structure-Mapping Theory,[method] experimental design,[pedagogy] Example-Based Learning; [pedagogy] Simulation-Based Learning,,[setting] higher education,[subject] science,[technology] simulations,[construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] transfer,"Structure-Mapping Theory, Cognitive Psychology,experimental design,Example-Based Learning, Simulation-Based Learning,science, undergraduate classrooms, simulations,transfer, conceptual understanding, reasoning",[theory] Cognitive Psychology; [theory] Structure-Mapping Theory; [method] experimental design; [pedagogy] Example-Based Learning; [pedagogy] Simulation-Based Learning; ; [setting] higher education; [subject] science; [technology] simulations; [construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] transfer,,

The role of scientific visualization within science is explicated through examples of its use and by presenting a sociological account of science that portrays scientific visualization as an important new inscriptional system. Three examples of using scientific visualization within education are provided: the Chem Viz Project at the National Center for Supercomputing Activities the image Processing for Teaching (IPT) project at the University of Arizona, and an undergraduate climatology course at the University of Chicago. Potential problems of integrating scientific visualization within secondary education are described, including student' need to learn basic scientific practices, incompatibilities between the format of the traditional high-school classroom and scientific inquiry, and the need for additional infrastructure within schools. Finally, possible solutions to these problems are described, culminating in a view of scientific visualization as a means to provide education with an important new inscriptional system for exploratory, inquiry-driven learning and to link the aims of education to the practices of science.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0403_1,[theory] Constructivism; [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR),[method] Case Study Research; [method] Constructivism (Research Paradigm); [method] Design-Based Research (DBR),[pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL),[population] middle school,,[subject] science,[technology] data visualization; [technology] visualization tools,,",scientific visualization,inquiry-based learning,constructivism,,,design-based research,technology integration,case study,,,,science education,visualization tools,middle school,,,data visualization,representational competence,inquiry learning,technology-mediated reasoning,",[theory] Constructivism; [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Case Study Research; [method] Constructivism (Research Paradigm); [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL); [population] middle school; ; [subject] science; [technology] data visualization; [technology] visualization tools; ,,
184,Learning How to Believe: Epistemic Development in Cultural Context,Gottlieb,2007,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Over the last decade, researchers have become increasingly interested in students' beliefs about the nature of knowledge and how these beliefs develop. Although initial psychological accounts portrayed epistemic development as a domain-independent process of cognitive maturation, recent studies have found trajectories of epistemic development to vary considerably across contexts. However, few studies have focused on cultural context. This article examines the role community values and practices play in fostering particular epistemological orientations by comparing the epistemological beliefs of 5th, 8th, and 12th graders (N = 200) from General and Religious schools in Israel regarding 2 controversies: belief in God and punishment of children. In both controversies, older participants were less likely than younger participants to consider the controversy rationally decidable. However, this shift emerged earlier in the God controversy than in the punishment controversy. In the God controversy, General pupils were less likely than Religious pupils to consider the question rationally decidable or their own beliefs infallible. But no such school differences were observed in the punishment controversy. Qualitative and quantitative analyses linked these differences to divergent discourse practices at General and Religious schools, suggesting that the relations between learning and epistemic development are more intricate than has been assumed hitherto.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508400709336941,[theory] Cultural Psychology; [theory] Developmental Psychology; [theory] Epistemic Cognition,[method] interview methods; [method] Mixed Methods; [method] surveys,,,,,,[construct] belief; [construct] development; [construct] epistemic cognition,"Epistemic Development Theory, Cultural Psychology, Developmental Psychology,mixed methods, surveys, qualitative interviews,—,religious and secular schools, children and adolescents,epistemic cognition, belief, cultural context, development",[theory] Cultural Psychology; [theory] Developmental Psychology; [theory] Epistemic Cognition; [method] interview methods; [method] Mixed Methods; [method] surveys; ; ; ; ; ; [construct] belief; [construct] development; [construct] epistemic cognition,,

Readings by religiously committed historians differed from those of their non-religious peers. Navigating between the competing commitments of their faith communities on the one hand and an academic guild on the other, religious historians engaged in epistemic switching, varying epistemological criteria to align with the allegiances triggered by the document under review. To explain these findings, we propose that historical understanding be conceived not as a unitary construct but as a form of coordination between multiple axes: a vertical axis of increasing intellectual sophistication as defined by the discipline; and a horizontal axis of identification and commitment, along which individuals move between a variety of allegiances and affiliations as they engage the epistemological criteria of sacred history.

It was assumed that the tools used to engage with historical information mediate thinking, and that when evaluating historical information online, participants would draw upon heuristics associated with Historical Thinking (Wineburg, 1991) and website evaluation. Method: The study involved qualitative interviews with historians and university students who evaluated three historical websites using a think-aloud protocol followed by semi-structured questioning. Findings: While sourcing, corroboration and contextualization remain the basis of disciplinary inquiry, the specific nature of each heuristic shifted when being used to evaluate online material, and a new category of intertextual ‘hybrid’ heuristics was formed as participants adapted general digital heuristics to evaluate historical information. Furthermore, these ‘hybrid heuristics’ had divergent effects on participants: for the students it appeared to inhibit critical historical thinking, whereas for the historians it formed the basis of their deep critical appraisal. Contribution: The findings have implications for research on historical thinking, history education and critical website evaluation.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2020.1834396,[theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] interview methods,,,[setting] online learning,,,,"Sociocultural Theory, Historical Thinking Framework (Wineburg, 1991), Critical Digital Literacy,think-aloud interviews, qualitative comparative analysis,Historical Thinking Instruction, Digital Literacy Education,history education, online learning environments,critical evaluation, sourcing, corroboration, contextualization, digital heuristics",[theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] interview methods; ; ; [setting] online learning; ; ; ,,
187,Fostering heterogeneous engineering through whole-class design work,Gravel & Svihla,2020,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Design problems have long attracted researchers’ attention for their potential to provide authentic learning opportunities. While we have methods for supporting students to learn through relatively simple engineering and design tasks, supporting students to address complex problems that they find and frame remains poorly understood. Designing for the real world presents opportunities to understand how heterogenous engineering practices emerge from students’ experiences, how problems are negotiated and reframed, and the forms of learning such experiences support. Descriptions of engineering practice often privilege technical aspects, where heterogeneous engineering emphasizes the active coordination of social and material dimensions as well. Methods: We present two cases from large, complex design projects: (1) a design-based research study in a school-based making space and (2) an extended participant observation in a design-build school. We used interaction analysis to characterize the forms of participation. Findings: We identified ways students negotiated social and material elements of design, how they coordinated these activities, and how the instructional environments contributed to developing heterogeneous practices. Contribution: Designers and materials both operated as agentive actors in dialogic conversations that coordinated the multitude of considerations involved in heterogeneous engineering.

Such evaluations depend highly upon prior knowledge. Therefore, the goal of epistemic education is the cultivation of apt epistemic performance: successfully achieving valuable epistemic aims (e.g., evaluating conflicting claims, discerning truth from falsehood) through competent use of ideals and reliable processes across a range of contexts. However, educators cannot prepare people for every contentious claim they will encounter over their lifetime. Therefore, we investigated if and how apt epistemic performance developed in one discipline could be adapted or transferred for use in another discipline. Methods: We analyzed think-aloud protocol data gathered as experts from psychology, other social sciences (i.e., near transfer), and natural sciences (i.e., far transfer) grappled with a complex problem: psychology’s replication crisis. Findings: An actor-oriented approach best captured how experts outside of psychology were able to near transfer or adapt epistemic performance; far transfer was more difficult. Contribution: Our findings suggest epistemic education for an informed citizenry should prioritize teaching disciplinary norms and practices as well as their scope and limitations, along with self-awareness of when transfer is and is not appropriate.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2020.1860992,,[method] interview methods,,,[setting] higher education,,,[construct] epistemic cognition; [construct] expertise; [construct] metacognition; [construct] transfer,"Epistemic Cognition Framework, Actor-Oriented Transfer, Expertise Theory,think-aloud interviews, qualitative comparative analysis,Epistemic Thinking, Scientific Reasoning Pedagogy,higher education, expert scientific reasoning,epistemic performance, transfer, expertise, reasoning, metacognition",; [method] interview methods; ; ; [setting] higher education; ; ; [construct] epistemic cognition; [construct] expertise; [construct] metacognition; [construct] transfer,,

This commentary characterizes these articles as contributing to 2 valuable themes of recent and ongoing research on transfer. One involves positioning of students in activity systems where they can learn or where their transfer is assessed. The other involves characteristics of knowing in conceptual domains. Based on the contributions of Engle, Marton, and others, this commentary conjectures that positioning with authority and accountability in learning and transfer settings (cf., Engle & Conant, 2002) and learning that develops connected knowing of affordances and constraints that are broadly characteristic of a domain (cf., Belenky, Clinchy, Goldberger, & Tarule, 1986; Gibson, 1979) are probably important contributing factors in supporting positive transfer.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls1504_4,[theory] Situative Perspective; [theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] conceptual modeling,[pedagogy] Community of Learners,,,,,[construct] accountability; [construct] community; [construct] transfer,"Sociocultural Theory, Situative Perspective, Framing Theory,conceptual analysis,Community of Learners,science and mathematics education, classroom discourse environments,transfer, positioning, accountability, connected knowing",[theory] Situative Perspective; [theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] conceptual modeling; [pedagogy] Community of Learners; ; ; ; ; [construct] accountability; [construct] community; [construct] transfer,,

An analysis of 4 purposefully selected students from 2 different classrooms reveals that membership in a classroom activity system does not determine one's emergent disposition toward learning. However, it is likely that similar types of dispositions might emerge within a single classroom activity system. The analysis further seeks to understand the mechanisms that underlie the ways in which dispositions are enacted in moments of interaction, and how aspects of classroom practice impact this enactment. The findings support the argument that social, affective, and motivational factors are not simply influences on learning but are, instead, central to and inseparable from the learning process.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400903013470,[theory] Identity Theory; [theory] Situated Cognition,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] participant observation,,,[setting] classrooms,[subject] mathematics,,[construct] engagement; [construct] identity; [construct] participation,"Dispositional Learning Theory, Situated Cognition, Identity Theory,discourse analysis, classroom observation,Inquiry-Based Mathematics Instruction,mathematics education, middle school classrooms,disposition, opportunity to learn, identity, engagement, participation",[theory] Identity Theory; [theory] Situated Cognition; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] participant observation; ; ; [setting] classrooms; [subject] mathematics; ; [construct] engagement; [construct] identity; [construct] participation,,

Joram, 1995) have contended that a reason for students' difficulties in learning physics is that students think about concepts as things rather than as processes and that there is a significant barrier between these 2 ontological categories. We contest this view, arguing that expert and novice reasoning often and productively traverses ontological categories. We cite examples from everyday, classroom, and professional contexts to illustrate this. We agree with Chi and Slotta that instruction should attend to learners' ontologies, but we find that these ontologies are better understood as dynamic and context dependent rather than as static constraints. To promote 1 ontological description in physics instruction, as suggested by Slotta and Chi, could undermine novices' access to productive cognitive resources that they bring to their studies and inhibit their transition to the dynamic ontological flexibility required of experts.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2010.491751,,[method] conceptual modeling,,,,[subject] physics,,[construct] conceptual understanding,"Knowledge-in-Pieces (KiP), Dynamic Ontologies Framework, Constructivist Theory,conceptual analysis, case illustration,—,physics education, conceptual framework paper,ontology, reasoning, conceptual change, context sensitivity, dynamic cognition",; [method] conceptual modeling; ; ; ; [subject] physics; ; [construct] conceptual understanding,,

We describe the creation and study of 2 programs designed to significantly enhance students' inquiry skills at any interactive science museum exhibit without the need for advanced preparation by teachers or chaperones. The programs, called Inquiry Games, utilized educational principles from the learning sciences and from visitor studies of museum field trips. A randomized experimental design compared 2 versions of the games to 2 control conditions. Results indicate that the groups that learned the Inquiry Games significantly outperformed the control groups in the duration and quality of several inquiry skills when using a novel exhibit, with effect sizes ranging from 0.3σ to 0.8σ. The highest gains came from an Inquiry Game that was structured and collaborative rather than spontaneous and individualized.

Such forums are interesting because they are not only one of the easiest technologies to add to a class but may also provide an important learning opportunity for students. However, simply making a discussion forum available does not mean that it will be used effectively to enable learning. In this paper, we explore the idea that specific features of a discussion forum may increase the likelihood of effective discussions taking place within the forum. We define effective discussions as those that are sustained and are focused on topics related to class learning goals. We then describe the specifications for an electronic discussion forum-a computer-mediated anchored discussion forum-that we propose makes sustained on-topic discussion more likely. We report on the results of two studies that support this proposal.

Yet despite this, educational software has traditionally attempted to harness games as extrinsic motivation by using them as a sugar coating for learning content. This article tests the concept of intrinsic integration as a way of creating a more productive relationship between educational games and their learning content. Two studies assessed this approach by designing and evaluating an educational game called Zombie Division to teach mathematics to 7- to 11-year-olds. Study 1 examined the learning gains of 58 children who played either the intrinsic, extrinsic, or control variants of Zombie Division for 2 hr, supported by their classroom teacher. Study 2 compared time on task for the intrinsic and extrinsic variants of the game when 16 children had free choice of which game to play. The results showed that children learned more from the intrinsic version of the game under fixed time limits and spent 7 times longer playing it in free-time situations. Together, these studies offer evidence for the genuine value of an intrinsic approach for creating effective educational games. The theoretical and commercial implications of these findings are discussed.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2010.508029,[theory] Cognitive Load Theory,[method] experimental design,[pedagogy] Cognitive Load Theory,,[setting] digital learning environments,,[technology] games,[construct] engagement; [construct] learning outcomes; [construct] motivation,"Motivation Theory, Cognitive Load Theory, Game-Based Learning Framework,experimental design, quantitative analysis,Game-Based Learning,computer science / STEM, digital learning environment, primary students,motivation, intrinsic integration, engagement, learning outcomes, design effectiveness",[theory] Cognitive Load Theory; [method] experimental design; [pedagogy] Cognitive Load Theory; ; [setting] digital learning environments; ; [technology] games; [construct] engagement; [construct] learning outcomes; [construct] motivation,,
199,Explanation Content and Construction During System Learning and Troubleshooting,Hale & Barsalou,1995,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Explanations have become increasingly recognized as central to learning and intelligence. To explore the content and construction of human explanations, detailed protocol analyses were performed on the explanations that subjects produced while learning about a fictional system. During the system learning phase of the experiment, subjects received a series of diagrams for a system and then explained how it worked. During the troubleshooting phase, in the absence of the diagrams, subjects explained relations between problematic symptoms and their faults. To examine the evolution of explanations with learning, subjects explained the same system diagrams and the same symptom-fault relations multiple times. Explanations varied considerably between system learning and troubleshooting, indicating that different goals produced different explanations. During system learning, subjects focused almost exclusively on functional explanations, exhibiting no trend toward deeper mechanistic explanations over time. To construct these functional understandings, subjects primarily instantiated existing knowledge in memory, specializing it to explain the purposes of individual components. During troubleshooting, subjects still focused on function but included a much wider variety of functional information in their explanations as well as higher proportions of topographical and mechanistic information. Rather than focusing on individual components, subjects focused on qualitative relations between components as they attempted to understand forward causal relations from faults to symptoms. Also, unlike system learning, explanations during troubleshooting evolved significantly over time, shifting from qualitative reasoning to reminding. The topography and coherence of the diagrams studied in system learning affected subjects' explanations substantially: During system learning, explanations were more efficient and mechanistic when topography and coherence were present than they were.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0404_2,[theory] Cognitive Task Analysis; [theory] Mental Models Theory,[method] Cognitive Task Analysis; [method] experimental design; [method] protocol analysis,,,,,,[construct] reasoning,",mental models,functional and mechanistic explanation,qualitative reasoning,,,protocol analysis,experimental study,cognitive task analysis,,,,system learning,troubleshooting tasks,engineering contexts,,,explanation construction,causal reasoning,function vs mechanism,analogy,reminding,",[theory] Cognitive Task Analysis; [theory] Mental Models Theory; [method] Cognitive Task Analysis; [method] experimental design; [method] protocol analysis; ; ; ; ; ; [construct] reasoning,,

200,Representation as Shared Activity: Situated Cognition and Dewey's Cartography of Experience,Hall,1996,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Dewey described the continuity of experience and the interaction of individuals with their environments as longitude and latitude for locating educative experience. This article examines three aspects of Dewey's Pragmatist philosophy as intellectual roots for current work in situated cognition. These aspects are used to organize a case analysis of two teachers working together to solve and design instruction for a typical algebra problem. The analysis focuses on interactional phenomena and argues that these phenomena are usually left out of studies of cognition and that they are critically important for understanding effective teaching. A close analysis of interaction supports a view of representation as shared activity, as an alternative to traditional cognitive accounts that focus exclusively on an individual's mental structures. In the moment-to-moment production and explanation of inferences about the mathematical structure of a problem, representations are activities in which these teachers are jointly engaged, rather than things that they individually have. Interpreting representation as a shared activity extends Dewey's cartography as a basis for studying mathematical experience and teaching.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0503_3,[theory] Deweyan Pragmatism / Deweyan Philosophy; [theory] Situated Cognition,[method] conceptual modeling; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA),[pedagogy] Collaborative Learning; [pedagogy] Experience-Based Learning,,,,,[construct] representations,",situated cognition,Deweyan pragmatism,representation as activity,,,theoretical synthesis,discourse analysis,,,,classroom learning,collaborative problem solving,,,representations,distributed meaning-making,joint activity,experience-based learning,",[theory] Deweyan Pragmatism / Deweyan Philosophy; [theory] Situated Cognition; [method] conceptual modeling; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [pedagogy] Collaborative Learning; [pedagogy] Experience-Based Learning; ; ; ; ; [construct] representations,,

205,Digital Art Making as a Representational Process,Halverson,2012,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"In this article I bring artistic production into the learning sciences conversation by using the production of representations as a bridging concept between art making and the new literacies. Through case studies with 4 youth media arts organizations across the United States I ask how organizations structure the process of producing autobiographical digital art through a focus on representational tasks and how learning can be traced by examining youth artists' representations over time. Using a distributed cognition framework I analyze data on the process of making digital art in terms of the macro and micro tasks performed in order to identify occasions for external representation construction and use across organizations. I then examine how individual youth engage in these macro and micro tasks by producing representations that demonstrate their understanding. These analyses show that youth media arts organization production processes engage young artists in a representational trajectory that begins with developing a story about the self, moves toward a focus on how the tools of the medium afford representation of that story, and culminates in digital representations that reflect an understanding of the relationship between story and tools.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2011.639471,[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Interaction / Video Analysis,[pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR),,,,,[construct] creativity; [construct] identity; [construct] representations,"Multimodal Learning Framework, Sociocultural Theory, Creativity and Representation Framework,design-based research, video analysis, interview study,Arts-Based Learning, Digital Media Pedagogy,arts education, middle school digital art classrooms,representation, identity, creativity, design, multimodality",[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); ; ; ; ; [construct] creativity; [construct] identity; [construct] representations,,

DiSessa and his colleagues (diSessa, 1988, 1993; Smith, diSessa, & Roschelle, 1993/1994) have challenged the theoretical and empirical validity of this perspective and offered an alternative account of cognitive structure in phenomenological primitives or p-prims. The purpose of this article is to further clarify and contrast the two accounts: in particular, to consider their utility and generativity as conceptual tools for teachers. How may each perspective influence instructional perceptions and intentions?

First, articles are often published that provide only very brief excerpts of the qualitative data themselves to illustrate the coding scheme, tacitly or explicitly treating the coding results as data. Second, articles are often published that treat interrater reliability solely as a matter of justifying the coding scheme, without further attention to the variance it makes evident in the process of coding. We argue that authors should not treat coding results as data but rather as tabulations of claims about data and that it is important to discuss the rates and substance of disagreements among coders.

Debates such as this regarding subtleties of cognitive theory, however, may be difficult to connect to everyday instructional practice. Our purpose in this article is to make that connection. We first review reasons for supporting the latter account, of naive epistemologies as made up of fine-grained, context-sensitive resources; as part of this argument we note that familiar strategies and curricula tacitly ascribe epistemological resources to students. We then present several strategies designed more explicitly to help students tap those resources for learning introductory physics. Finally, we reflect on this work as an example of interplay between 2 modes of inquiry into student thinking, that of instruction and that of formal research on learning.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1201_3,[theory] Constructivism; [theory] Epistemic Cognition; [theory] Knowledge in Pieces,[method] coding and categorization; [method] Constructivism (Research Paradigm); [method] interview methods; [method] qualitative coding,,,[setting] higher education,[subject] physics,,[construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] epistemic cognition; [construct] reflection,"Epistemic Cognition, Knowledge in Pieces, Constructivism,case study research, interviews, qualitative coding,Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL),physics, undergraduate classrooms,epistemic cognition, reasoning, reflection, conceptual understanding",[theory] Constructivism; [theory] Epistemic Cognition; [theory] Knowledge in Pieces; [method] coding and categorization; [method] Constructivism (Research Paradigm); [method] interview methods; [method] qualitative coding; ; ; [setting] higher education; [subject] physics; ; [construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] epistemic cognition; [construct] reflection,,

Its aim is to combine what seem to be two distinct and conflicting approaches to memory-the functional approach of A1 and the empirical approach of psychology-and propose a unified view that does not compromise the nature of either field yet resolves the existing conflicts between them. To do this we propose a shift away from the narrow view of analogical reminding as an isolated memory behavior and toward a more general view of memory as a process that serves the needs of planning, problem solving, and understanding. This shift involves changes to both the functional arguments that have arisen in A1 and a reexamination of the empirical evidence that has been presented in psychology.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0102_1,,[method] comparative analysis,,,,,[technology] artificial intelligence,[construct] memory; [construct] problem solving,",analogical transfer,functional memory,descriptive memory,ai-psychology integration,,,comparative analysis,cognitive science,theory-building,,,,analogy,problem solving,planning,memory,,,analogical reminding,cross-domain transfer,memory organization,",; [method] comparative analysis; ; ; ; ; [technology] artificial intelligence; [construct] memory; [construct] problem solving,,

We observed first-hand and second-hand investigations to work in concert to provide young students with rich opportunities to learn about motion and to express their developing understandings of scientific ideas.

We further argue that traditional school science laboratory investigations misconstrue the nature of data and overly constrain student agency in their production. We use our “Data Production” framework to analyze activity of and interviews with high school students who created data using sensors and software in a ninth-grade integrated science class. To understand the opportunities for students to develop act with and perceive agency in data production, we analyze in detail the case of one student as she came to use unfamiliar technologies to produce data for her own personally relevant purposes. We find that her purposes for producing data emerged as she worked, and that resistances to her purposes were opportunities to act with and perceive her own agency, and to see data in new ways.

This “nested” data situates learners’ scientific activity within larger datasets, projects, and communities, with consequences for youth agency. To document opportunities for agentive learning with data in YCCS, we report on how youth interact with data across eight school and community-based project sites and how youth talk about their data and work. From analysis of 54 participant interviews, we found that youth perceived the data they produced as being used for: (1) broader scientific work, (2) their own learning, and (3) community endeavors. Nested uses of data were most meaningful when youth interacted with end users, were exposed to the larger datasets to which they contributed, or took action linked to data. Not all youth saw, believed, or valued that data would be used by others. Framing of task and purpose, nature of engagement with community users, data production protocols, and level of emphasis on youth-identified questions may contribute to youth perceptions and can foster or undermine conditions for learner agency.

The goal of this article is twofold: First, to move the discourse away from comparing constructivist learning environments solely to traditional learning environments. The 2nd goal is to move away from talking of a single constructivist learning environment, and instead to explore the nuances of learning environments based on different theoretical assumptions. Toward these ends, we analyze 2 summer camps in terms of theoretical assumptions, community and groups, participant roles, practices, and other evidence of learning.

217,Learning Along Lines: Locative Literacies for Reading and Writing the City,Headrick Taylor,2017,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The “everyware” paradigm opens up new possibilities for learning on-the-move with technologies through urban spaces while also raising questions about emerging literacies required of users to understand and use the digital traces these technologies generate. This article develops locative literacies as a way of understanding place-based, digital modes of reading and writing different representational forms at the scale of the city. I explore a new analytic unit, learning along lines, as a tool for supporting the design and analysis of learning contexts where the leading mode of engagement for young learners was physical and digital mobility through the city. Learning along lines emerged from a design study in which youth produced counter-maps of their neighborhood to share with city stakeholders. Using a spatiotemporal framewo rk, I analyze youth learning locative literacies along lines they made of their neighborhood through a designed task, global positioning system (GPS) drawing. First, I focus on young people learning to scale their mobility to a neighborhood grid along lines they made through walking and gesture. Second, I focus on young people learning to negotiate inscriptions along lines they made by walking with maps and GPS devices through their neighborhood. Third, I focus on youth learning to re-member their embodied effort along lines they made discursively during moments of reflection. The analyses are intended to push the field’s understanding of mobility in conceptualizing and designing new forms of learning locative literacies. Learning along lines foregrounds humans not merely as consumers or generators of texts but as being part of that text, literacy agents of a text they populate.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2017.1307198,[theory] Sociomaterial Theory,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA),[pedagogy] Multimodal Literacy,,,[subject] literacy,,[construct] identity,"Multimodal Literacy, Spatial Learning Theory, Sociomaterial Theory,ethnographic fieldwork, discourse analysis,Place-Based Learning, Multimodal Literacy,literacy education, urban learning environments,literacy, place, mapping, identity, multimodality",[theory] Sociomaterial Theory; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [pedagogy] Multimodal Literacy; ; ; [subject] literacy; ; [construct] identity,,
218,Unpacking the Learning Ecosystems Framework: Lessons from the Adaptive Management of Biological Ecosystems,Hecht & Crowley,2019,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"An ecological framework is often used to describe the context for learning in educational research and practice. However, there is often a focus on descriptive aspects that frame the ecosystem as a complicated set of interconnected elements—but not a true complex problem. Acknowledging connections between ecosystem elements is not enough to affect the systemic change that the wicked problem of education requires. In this paper, we argue for moving toward a more robust framework that takes seriously the notion of learning happening via relational processes between system elements, and looks more deeply at the ways in which those dynamic elements are interacting in complex, multiscalar ways. We promote drawing more heavily from ecologists’ understanding of biological systems, particularly the application of concepts drawn from adaptive management strategies used in the field of restoration ecology. We present an argument to decentre our field’s typical focus on individual youth, just as ecologists have moved biology away from an emphasis on individual organisms. We postulate that decentring youth enables new ways of thinking about learning ecosystem design and management. We then explore three specific concepts used in adaptive management in ecology: ecotones, keystone and indicator species, and disturbance and resilience.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2019.1693381,[theory] Complex Systems Theory; [theory] Networked Learning; [theory] Systems Theory,[method] conceptual modeling,[pedagogy] Networked Learning,,,,,[construct] adaptability; [construct] complexity; [construct] systems thinking,"Learning Ecosystems Framework, Complex Systems Theory, Adaptive Management Theory,theoretical synthesis, case comparison,Systems Thinking, Networked Learning,informal science learning, ecological and museum contexts,learning ecosystems, complexity, design, adaptation, interdependence",[theory] Complex Systems Theory; [theory] Networked Learning; [theory] Systems Theory; [method] conceptual modeling; [pedagogy] Networked Learning; ; ; ; ; [construct] adaptability; [construct] complexity; [construct] systems thinking,,

We advocate a dialogic approach to developing argument skills and in the work reported here examine the further scaffold of prompts that exemplify functions of evidence in relation to a claim. This scaffold was successful in accelerating the prevalence of evidence-based claims in essays of low-performing middle schoolers compared to participants in the same year-long dialog-based intervention who received no or a limited form of evidence prompts and compared to previous samples engaged in a nondialogic curriculum. An experimental group achieved a proportion of evidence-based claims above 50% by the end of the year, transferring their newly developing skill from one topic to another. The use of different types of evidence emerged in a sequence corresponding to the cognitive demands they posed. Students first used support-own evidence. They used weaken-other evidence increasingly over time, but the two evidence types inconsistent with their position (support-other and weaken-own) showed lesser and later gains. Supporting a dialogic approach, qualitative data showed that evidence use occurred most readily in dialogs; then in individual writing on the same topic; and to a more limited extent in essays on a new, unstudied topic.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2017.1336714,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,

This work adds a sociopolitical perspective, explicating a case of a newcomer to a robotics team that elucidates the nuances of in-the-moment social positioning and its enduring impact on youth’s participation in afterschool STEM learning environments. Methods: Through interaction analysis of three episodes and ethnographic perspectives, participants’ contributions to social interaction are analyzed as chronotopes, or spacetime representations, to understand how Denisse’s, a young Black and Latinx woman, role as the driver of the team’s robot at competitions is collaboratively crafted, building on the feminist tradition of positioning theory. Findings: My analysis shows that Denisse is both empowered, through co-production of future decision-making in practice, and disempowered, through the rejection of non-present spacetime storylines at the competition. Further, notions of expertise and ownership are brought to bear on interactions, together with racialized and gendered narratives across the negotiations of the role of the driver to limit Denisse’s local social power.

Three principles, derived from a sociocognitive perspective on science teaching and learning, undergird this instruction: (a) engaging students in reasoning practices in science, (b) offering explicit guidance on the roles students can assume to monitor their own and their peers' thinking, and (c) fostering a sophisticated epistemology of science by having students experience science as a process of revision. The participants were members of a Grade 314 split-level gifted class and a Grade 5 class in an urban district. Instruction occurred over a 10-week period, in which students worked in small-group and whole-class contexts to develop and refine explanations for floating and sinking. Pre- and postassessment data revealed changes in children's conceptual understanding, as well as changes in their beliefs about the nature of scientific problem solving. The primary data were transcripts of whole-class discussions that were analyzed to reveal how children's notions of theorizing evolved over the course of the program of study through a process of negotiation that was significantly guided by the teachers, supported by the roles that students assumed, and assisted with the use of an array of tools, such as theory and question charts, as well as the investigative activity itself.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.1999.9672076,[theory] Epistemic Education / Epistemology of Science; [theory] Social-Cognitive Theory; [theory] Vygotskian Theory,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Mixed Methods,[pedagogy] Communities of Practice; [pedagogy] Scaffolding,[population] elementary education,[setting] classrooms,[subject] science,,[construct] epistemology; [construct] scaffolding; [construct] scientific reasoning,",sociocognitive theory,Vygotskian theory,scientific reasoning,,,classroom intervention,discourse analysis,mixed methods,,,,elementary education,science education,classroom communities,,,scaffolding,inquiry learning,epistemology of science,student roles,theory–evidence coordination,",[theory] Epistemic Education / Epistemology of Science; [theory] Social-Cognitive Theory; [theory] Vygotskian Theory; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Mixed Methods; [pedagogy] Communities of Practice; [pedagogy] Scaffolding; [population] elementary education; [setting] classrooms; [subject] science; ; [construct] epistemology; [construct] scaffolding; [construct] scientific reasoning,,
222,Investigating Elementary Students' Scientific and Historical Argumentation,Herrenkohl & Cornelius,2013,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article examines the relationship between epistemic cognition and classroom argumentation practices in elementary science and history. Literature highlights argumentation as a critical epistemic practice for science and history learning (Duschl & J. Osborne, 2002; National Research Council, 2007, 2012). Although there is ample support for argumentation in the teaching of history and science, the specific epistemic issues that students address through this practice are not always empirically documented. We draw on the work of CitationChinn, Buckland, and Samarapungavan (2011) to examine argumentation practices in science and history in 2 fifth-grade and 2 sixth-grade urban classrooms. Students' and teachers' emergent argumentation practices were coded and analyzed and epistemic reasoning was examined using the 5 components of the Chinn et al. model. Findings highlight that students engaged in complex argumentation practices that were consistent across classrooms. The classroom case examples demonstrate that students addressed all 5 epistemic components in the Chinn et al. model through their argumentation practice. Further research to better understand the relationship between teacher epistemic commitments, pedagogical practices, and student epistemic commitments and learning is suggested.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2013.799475,[theory] Argumentation Theory; [theory] Epistemic Cognition; [theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] Case Study Research; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA),,,[setting] elementary classrooms,,,[construct] argumentation; [construct] collaboration; [construct] epistemic cognition; [construct] evidence,"Argumentation Theory, Sociocultural Theory, Disciplinary Literacy Framework,classroom discourse analysis, case study,Argumentation-Based Learning, Disciplinary Inquiry,science and history education, elementary classrooms,argumentation, epistemic cognition, evidence use, disciplinary reasoning, collaboration",[theory] Argumentation Theory; [theory] Epistemic Cognition; [theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] Case Study Research; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); ; ; [setting] elementary classrooms; ; ; [construct] argumentation; [construct] collaboration; [construct] epistemic cognition; [construct] evidence,,
223,Toward an Understanding of How Threads Die in Asynchronous Computer Conferences,Hewitt,2005,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Previous computer conferencing research has been concerned with the organizational, technical, social, and motivational factors that support and sustain online interaction. This article studies online interaction from a different perspective. Rather than analyze the processes that sustain discourse, the following research examines how and why discussions shut down. A computer simulation of asynchronous threaded interaction suggests that certain common online habits, when practiced by many people, can adversely affect the lifespan of some threads. Specifically, the widespread practice of focusing attention on unread notes during computer conferencing sessions can produce a starvation condition that hastens the death of some threads and reduces the likelihood that inactive threads will become active again. The longevity of a thread, therefore, is partially affected by the kinds of routines that online participants follow when they use a computer conferencing interface. The educational implications of this finding are discussed, and strategies are presented for limiting adverse educational effects.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls1404_4,,[method] content analysis; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] log analysis,,,[setting] higher education; [setting] online learning,,[technology] learning analytics; [technology] online forums,[construct] collaboration; [construct] interaction; [construct] participation,"Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), Discourse Theory,discourse analysis, content analysis, log analysis,Online Collaborative Learning (OCL),online learning environments, higher education, discussion forums,participation, interaction, thread sustainability, collaboration",; [method] content analysis; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] log analysis; ; ; [setting] higher education; [setting] online learning; ; [technology] learning analytics; [technology] online forums; [construct] collaboration; [construct] interaction; [construct] participation,,

The proposed framework is used to analyze the case of Idit, a girl who started out as a high achiever in 7th-grade math and ended up failing that same subject in 9th grade, complaining of severe “mathematics anxiety.” This article traces the narratives endorsed by Idit’s parents and teacher, which form the background for the development of her ritual participation in mathematical discourse. Next it attempts to link Idit’s ritual participation in a course I taught with her eventual failure in mathematics. The mechanism behind this failure is conceptualized as a vicious cycle that thrives on the basis of a ritualistic discourse motivated mainly by grades and other instrumental motives for learning mathematics. The analysis of this case gives rise to a model of how mathematical identities of failure may develop hand in hand with the failure to learn new mathematical skills.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2014.999270,[theory] Identity Theory; [theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [method] longitudinal study; [theory] Interaction Analysis,,,,[subject] mathematics,,[construct] affect; [construct] failure; [construct] identity; [construct] participation,"Identity Theory, Sociocultural Theory, Positioning Theory,longitudinal case study, interaction analysis,Identity-Based Mathematics Learning,mathematics education, classroom discourse,identity, failure, positioning, participation, affect",[theory] Identity Theory; [theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [method] longitudinal study; [theory] Interaction Analysis; ; ; ; [subject] mathematics; ; [construct] affect; [construct] failure; [construct] identity; [construct] participation,,
225,"Multilevel Assessment for Discourse, Understanding, and Achievement",Hickey & Zuiker,2012,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Evaluating the impact of instructional innovations and coordinating instruction, assessment, and testing present complex tensions. Many evaluation and coordination efforts aim to address these tensions by using the coherence provided by modern cognitive science perspectives on domain-specific learning. This paper introduces an alternative framework that uses emerging situative assessment perspectives to align learning across increasingly formal levels of educational practice. This framework emerged from 2 design studies of a 20-hr high school genetics curriculum that used the GenScope computer-based modeling software. The 1st study aligned learning across (a) the contextualized enactment of inquiry-oriented activities in GenScope, (b) “feedback conversations” around informal embedded assessments, and (c) a formal performance assessment; the 2nd study extended this alignment to a conventional achievement test. Design-based refinements ultimately delivered gains of nearly 2 SD on the performance assessment and more than 1 SD in achievement. These compared to gains of 0.25 and 0.50 SD, respectively, in well-matched comparison classrooms.

The first approach is the traditional medical education that involves lectures supplemented by laboratory exercises. The second approach is problem-based learning (PBL). In PBL, students learn basic science in small groups in the context of authentic patient problems. Because an expected outcome of medical education is to move students along the path from naive laypersons to novice physicians, the effects of these approaches should be understood in terms of how they affect the early acquisition of cognitive skill.

We argue that this design focuses on developing tools and interactions that the player can use for inquiry and productive thinking. As a step toward achieving this goal, we propose the constructible authentic representations design principle and illustrate this principle using a prototype game, Particles!, for exploring the particulate nature of matter. Observations of game play and interviews with 9 children ages 11–14 suggest that core game representations and mechanics provided players with a space for engaging in useful scientific practices and knowledge resources for reasoning about the important role molecular structure plays in material properties beyond the game. We explore how this design proposal extends and complements existing constructivist game design frameworks. Furthermore, we suggest that the framework of games as objects-to-think-with should push the educational game design community to consider the complexity and nuance of cognition and to embrace and champion the learner in game design.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2018.1487302,[theory] Constructionism; [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Embodied Knowing / Embodiment,[method] computational modeling; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR),[pedagogy] Constructionism; [pedagogy] Design-Based Learning (DBL); [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Learning-by-Design (LBD),,,[subject] STEM,[technology] computational modeling; [technology] computational thinking,[construct] play,"Constructionism, Computational Modeling, Design-Based Learning,design-based research, qualitative design analysis,Constructionist Learning, Computational Thinking,STEM education, informal digital learning environment,computational thinking, design, modeling, embodiment, play",[theory] Constructionism; [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Embodied Knowing / Embodiment; [method] computational modeling; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Constructionism; [pedagogy] Design-Based Learning (DBL); [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Learning-by-Design (LBD); ; ; [subject] STEM; [technology] computational modeling; [technology] computational thinking; [construct] play,,
230,Learning with and beyond the body: The production of mobile architectures in a ballet variations class,Hollett et al.,2021,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: This paper examines ensemble learning in the context of ballet. We use more-than-representational theory to account for the “invisible” dimensions of ensemble learning, such as sensations, energy, or intensity that bodies sense, circulate, and evoke in others. We illuminate the mobile architectures that emerge in ensemble learning. Mobile architectures emerge when a performance (i.e., dance, athletic, drama), event (i.e., protest, sermon), or environment (i.e., classroom, makerspace) becomes charged as energy is evoked and circulated among bodies.Methods We describe eighteen months of video-recorded inquiry of teaching and learning in a weekly classical ballet variations class. We used interaction analysis to understand how sensations and energies move (among) bodies during learning.Findings Through our analysis, we show: 1) How mobile architectures form and dissolve, particularly as instructional time begins; 2) How audible expressions communicate energy and modulate ensemble learning and 3) How instruction transforms as the ensemble comes together and pulls apart.Contributions This paper contributes a deeper understanding of how learners attune to the relational complexity of learning. It offers accounts of the more-than-representational dimensions of embodiment and calls for further attention beyond the bodies of embodied learning (physical, gestural, tool-mediated dimensions) and toward the intensities, or energies, that those bodies produce together.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2021.2003801,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,

The study reported in this article draws on systems-of-practice theory to focus on the dynamic interplay among actors, artifacts, and tasks that constrains activities such as course planning and constitutes other activities, such as classroom instruction. This qualitative case study of faculty teaching in math and science disciplines at 3 research universities is based on interview and classroom observation data (n = 57 instructors) that are analyzed using causal network and social network analysis techniques. Results indicate that course syllabi are important organizational artifacts that are created by curriculum committees, inherited from previous instructors, and shaped by consideration of the sequential acquisition of knowledge. Faculty perceived that although course syllabi delimit the type and temporal sequencing of material for faculty, they are generally free to teach how they like. Observation data reveal discipline-specific configurations in frequently used teaching methods, cognitive engagements, and the use of instructional technology. These results also demonstrate that conceptualizing teaching solely as the use of particular methods (e.g., lecture) obscures subtle features of practice.

However, faculty are rarely trained to design courses that emphasize complex, cultural skills like communication, highlighting the need for professional development that adopts a sociocultural perspective on skills, teaching and faculty learning. Methods: In this paper, we describe a mixed-methods study that aimed to document instructional practice based on decision-making interviews (n=25), classroom observations (n=20) and surveys (n=496) with faculty in two U.S. cities. Techniques used to analyze these data include inductive thematic analysis, social network analysis, and hierarchical linear modeling. Findings: Results of the analysis include the identification of key elements of course planning – faculty predispositions, perceived affordances, and instructional goals—which dynamically interact to inform teaching practices. Classroom observations revealed a range of methods from lecturing to classroom debates. Results also highlight three factors that led to teaching decisions: prior experience in industry which sensitized faculty to employer needs, social networks, and student skills. Contributions: The data contribute to research on skills-focused instruction, and we conclude the paper with a description of a socioculturally informed faculty development program based on study findings.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2021.1936533,[theory] (Cultural-Historical) Activity Theory (CHAT),[method] cross-case analysis,,,[setting] higher education,,,[construct] communication; [construct] discourse; [construct] reflection,"Sociocultural Communication Theory, Activity Theory,cross-case comparative analysis, qualitative interview study,Communication Pedagogy, Sociocultural Instructional Design,higher education, communication classrooms,communication practices, sociocultural mediation, discourse, reflection, professional learning",[theory] (Cultural-Historical) Activity Theory (CHAT); [method] cross-case analysis; ; ; [setting] higher education; ; ; [construct] communication; [construct] discourse; [construct] reflection,,

This study compares the conversations of 2 groups of high school mathematics teachers addressing the Mismatch Problem when implementing equity-geared reforms. Although East High teachers challenged conceptions that were not aligned with a reform, South High teachers reworked a reform mandate to align with their existing conceptions. This research found that the teachers' conversational category systems modeled problems of practice; communicated assumptions about students, subject, and teaching; and were ultimately reflected in the curriculum. Because East High teachers supported greater numbers of students' success in advanced mathematics, this study considers the relation between teachers' understandings of student learning and the success of equity-geared math reforms. In addition, this study contributes to the understanding of how teacher conceptions of students are negotiated and reified in context, specifically through interactions with colleagues and experiences with school reform.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508400709336942,[theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Ethnography,[pedagogy] Equity Pedagogy,[population] in-service teachers; [population] teachers,,[subject] mathematics,,[construct] discourse; [construct] equity; [construct] identity,"Sociocultural Theory, Framing Theory, Equity Pedagogy,ethnography, discourse analysis, comparative case study,Teacher Collaborative Inquiry, Equity-Oriented Pedagogy,mathematics education, high school departments, in-service teachers,framing, equity, identity, discourse, reform implementation",[theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Ethnography; [pedagogy] Equity Pedagogy; [population] in-service teachers; [population] teachers; ; [subject] mathematics; ; [construct] discourse; [construct] equity; [construct] identity,,

Using a discourse perspective on learning, this article compares opportunities to learn (OTLs) in the collaborative conversations of 3 mathematics teacher workgroups. We examined the differences in OTLs in 17 hr of videotaped meetings from 3 groups at different levels of instructional accomplishment in secondary mathematics. Using mixed methods, we uncovered differences in the groups’ interactions and found that OTLs were not equally distributed. Instead, teacher groups whose active participants demonstrated the greatest facility with ambitious instruction also had the richest conversational OTLs. We interpret this as an accumulated advantage developmental story: Because collaborative work in teaching involves problem posing and the articulation of practice, teachers’ conceptions get built into the framing and discussion of pedagogical problems. Accomplished teachers are thus positioned to learn more from talking with colleagues. This analysis contributes to understanding of how OTLs are constituted in teacher workgroups, with implications for making better use of teacher collaboration for professional learning.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2015.1034865,[theory] Communities of Practice; [theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] Interaction / Video Analysis,[pedagogy] Communities of Practice,,,[subject] mathematics,,[construct] collaboration; [construct] discourse; [construct] reflection,"Sociocultural Theory, Communities of Practice, Teacher Learning Framework,video analysis, discourse coding,Collaborative Professional Development,mathematics education, teacher workgroups,teacher learning, discourse, collaboration, practice-based learning, reflection",[theory] Communities of Practice; [theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [pedagogy] Communities of Practice; ; ; [subject] mathematics; ; [construct] collaboration; [construct] discourse; [construct] reflection,,

Designs must generally function on their own without the support of teachers or curriculum while at the same time engaging a diverse audience, supporting productive social interaction, and activating appropriate prior knowledge and skills. In this article, I present an approach to the design of informal learning experiences based on tangible interaction. The term tangible refers to a variety of human–computer interaction techniques that move beyond computer screens and create opportunities for people to interact with digital systems using their bodies and physical artifacts. I argue that tangible interaction creates unique opportunities for designers to shape objects and situations to evoke cultural forms of literacy, learning, and play. In particular, I propose a class of cultural forms called cueing forms that can invite participation into patterned social activity while cueing cognitive, physical, and emotional resources on the part of individuals. To illustrate these arguments, I describe 3 design cases that colleagues and I have created to support learning in museums and homes.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2018.1468259,[theory] (Cultural-Historical) Activity Theory (CHAT); [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Embodied Cognition; [theory] Embodied Knowing / Embodiment,[method] Case Study Research; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR),[pedagogy] Design for Learning; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR),,[setting] informal learning,,,[construct] interaction; [construct] participation,"Embodied Cognition, Cultural Historical Activity Theory, Design for Learning Framework,design-based research, case study,Tangible Interaction Design, Informal Learning Design,informal learning, museum exhibits and public installations,embodiment, interaction, cultural tools, design, participation",[theory] (Cultural-Historical) Activity Theory (CHAT); [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Embodied Cognition; [theory] Embodied Knowing / Embodiment; [method] Case Study Research; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Design for Learning; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); ; [setting] informal learning; ; ; [construct] interaction; [construct] participation,,
236,Teacher–Student Dialogue During Classroom Teaching: Does It Really Impact on Student Outcomes?,Howe et al.,2019,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"It is now widely believed that classroom dialogue matters as regards student outcomes, with optimal patterns often regarded as requiring some or all of open questions, elaboration of previous contributions, reasoned discussion of competing viewpoints, linkage and coordination across contributions, metacognitive engagement with dialogue, and high student participation. To date, however, the relevance of such features has been most convincingly examined in relation to small-group interaction among students; little is known about their applicability to teacher–student dialogue. This article reports a large-scale study that permits some rebalancing. The study revolved around 2 lessons (covering 2 of mathematics, literacy, and science) that were video recorded in each of 72 demographically diverse classrooms (students’ ages 10–11 years). Key measures of teacher–student dialogue were related to 6 indices of student outcome, which jointly covered curriculum mastery, reasoning, and educationally relevant attitudes. Prior attainment and attitudes were considered in analyses, as were other factors (e.g., student demographics and further aspects of classroom practice) that might confound interpretation of dialogue–outcome relations. So long as students participated extensively, elaboration and querying of previous contributions were found to be positively associated with curriculum mastery, and elaboration was also positively associated with attitudes.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2019.1573730,,[method] Mixed Methods,[pedagogy] Scaffolding,,,,,[construct] dialogue; [construct] discourse; [construct] scaffolding,"Dialogic Teaching Framework, Sociocultural Learning Theory,mixed methods, quasi-experimental classroom study,Dialogic Teaching, Collaborative Discourse,general education, primary and secondary classrooms,dialogue, reasoning, student outcomes, talk moves, scaffolding",; [method] Mixed Methods; [pedagogy] Scaffolding; ; ; ; ; [construct] dialogue; [construct] discourse; [construct] scaffolding,,

However, other studies have shown that online environments have poor student participation Why is this the case? What causes participation to vary from one environment to another? To explore these phenomena, we borrow a concept from social psychology, the bystander effect, which explains why individuals are less likely to help in an emergency if others are present. Although the bystander effect specifically applies to helping behavior in emergency situations, we use this construct as a lens through which to view nonemergency situations such as educational environments. The bystander effect has 4 key components: self-awareness, social cues, blocking mechanisms, and diffuse responsibility. Focusing on these mechanisms can help us more fully characterize participation patterns observed in different educational environments and leverage this knowledge in the design of such systems. We present a case study of two students in both classroom and online French learning environments and show how the psychological mechanisms of the bystander effect help us understand observed behavioral changes.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1207/s15327809jls1302_2,[theory] Communities of Practice,[method] log analysis; [method] Mixed Methods; [method] surveys,[pedagogy] Communities of Practice,,[setting] online learning,,[technology] learning analytics; [technology] social media,[construct] community; [construct] engagement; [construct] participation,"Social Psychology, Communities of Practice,mixed methods, surveys, log analysis,Online Collaborative Learning (OCL),online learning environments, social media,participation, community, engagement",[theory] Communities of Practice; [method] log analysis; [method] Mixed Methods; [method] surveys; [pedagogy] Communities of Practice; ; [setting] online learning; ; [technology] learning analytics; [technology] social media; [construct] community; [construct] engagement; [construct] participation,,
238,Hinting as a Tactic in One-on-One Tutoring,Hume et al.,1996,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"One-on-one tutoring is a particularly effective mode of instruction, and we have studied the behavior of expert tutors in such a setting. A tactic commonly used by our expert tutors is hinting, that is, the prompting of a student to recollect information presumed to be known to him or her, or the prompting of a student to make an inference needed to solve a problem or answer a question, or both. Hints may directly convey information or may point to information the student already possesses. Another tactic prompts the student in a step-by-step manner (in a directed line of reasoning) to an answer. Our tutors generated 315 hints and directed lines of reasoning in 30 hr of tutoring. The surface structure of hints is complex and varied, reflecting, in part, the fact that the utterances making up hints often serve multiple functions. Hinting is triggered by student errors but ceases when it appears that the student is unable to respond appropriately. Hints encourage the student to engage in active cognitive processes that are thought to promote deeper understanding and long-term retention. It is our intention to apply our knowledge of tutorial dialogue generation to the building of an intelligent tutoring system (ITS).",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0501_2,,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] experimental design,[pedagogy] Scaffolding,,,,,[construct] feedback; [construct] scaffolding,",tutoring theory,scaffolding,dialogue-based learning,,,discourse analysis,tutoring dialogue study,experimental design,,,,one-on-one tutoring,biology and physiology education,,,hinting strategies,tutor–student interaction,feedback,instructional dialogue,",; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] experimental design; [pedagogy] Scaffolding; ; ; ; ; [construct] feedback; [construct] scaffolding,,

Because the prevailing genetic accounts of knowledge structures in mathematics education, cognitive science, and information-processing psychology do not explain key characteristics of the data, I begin to construct a new developmental account that does. To do so, I use forms, a class of schemata that combine patterns of algebra symbols with patterns of experience in the physical world, and 2 mechanisms, notation variation and mapping variation. I then use forms and the 2 mechanisms to analyze how the selected pair of students introduced and refined initial, faulty algebraic representations of the winch into an unconventional yet sound equation",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0901_4,[theory] Embodied Cognition; [theory] Model-Based Reasoning,[method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Microgenetic Method,,[population] middle school,,[subject] physics; [subject] science,,[construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] representations,",embodied cognition,model-based reasoning,representational learning,,,microgenetic analysis,classroom-based study,design research,,,,middle school,physics education,science education,,,inscription,model construction,conceptual change,representation,material artifacts,representations,",[theory] Embodied Cognition; [theory] Model-Based Reasoning; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Microgenetic Method; ; [population] middle school; ; [subject] physics; [subject] science; ; [construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] representations,,

The results complement past research by demonstrating that important components of the knowledge in pieces perspective are not tied to physics, more advanced mathematics, or the learning of older students. Furthermore, the study elaborates the perspective in a particular context by proposing knowledge for selecting attributes, using representations, and evaluating representations as analytic categories useful for highlighting some coordination and refinement processes that can arise when students learn to use external representations to solve problems. The results suggest, among other things, that explicitly identifying similarities and differences between students' past experiences using representations to solve problems and demands of new tasks can be central to successful instructional design.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls1403_2,[theory] Constructivism; [theory] Knowledge in Pieces,[method] Constructivism (Research Paradigm); [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [method] interview methods,,,[setting] elementary classrooms,[subject] mathematics,,[construct] conceptual understanding,"Knowledge in Pieces, Constructivism,case study research, interviews, video analysis,Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL),mathematics, elementary classrooms,conceptual understanding, reasoning, knowledge application, strategy use",[theory] Constructivism; [theory] Knowledge in Pieces; [method] Constructivism (Research Paradigm); [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [method] interview methods; ; ; [setting] elementary classrooms; [subject] mathematics; ; [construct] conceptual understanding,,

Analyzing data from a sequence of 4 lessons, we found that the teacher and her students used criteria for evaluating equations, in addition to other types of knowledge (e.g., different interpretations of the equal sign) previously reported in the literature. Moreover, the teacher and her students had trouble understanding one another's proposed algebraic models of problem situations due to differences in the criteria that each applied, and this impeded learning. These findings (a) extend an accumulating body of evidence for the role meta-representation plays in mathematics and science learning and (b) add a new dimension to researchers' growing understanding of what teachers must know in order to teach algebra and other complex mathematics and science topics effectively.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400903191912,[theory] Cognitive Psychology,[method] Microgenetic Method; [method] participant observation,,,[setting] classrooms,[subject] mathematics,,[construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] representations,"Meta-Representational Competence (MRC), Cognitive Psychology, Representation Theory,classroom observation, microgenetic analysis,Representation-Based Learning,mathematics education, high school classrooms,representation, abstraction, reasoning, conceptual understanding, generalization",[theory] Cognitive Psychology; [method] Microgenetic Method; [method] participant observation; ; ; [setting] classrooms; [subject] mathematics; ; [construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] representations,,
242,Engaging in Science: A Feeling for the Discipline,Jaber & Hammer,2015,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Most accounts of affect and motivation in the science education literature have discussed them as relevant to, but distinct from, disciplinary pursuits. These include Pintrich’s seminal work on affective and motivational factors in learning science (P. R. Pintrich, 1999, 2003; P. R. Pintrich & E. De Groot, 1990; P. R. Pintrich, R. W. Marx, & R. A. Boyle, 1993). Our purpose here is to build on those ideas, drawing as well on accounts of scientists’ practices (e.g., H. E. Gruber, 1974; E. F. Keller, 1983) and of students’ taking up of disciplinary pursuits (R. A. Engle & F. R. Conant, 2002; R. Lehrer, 2009; M. Scardamalia & C. Bereiter, 1991, 2006) to propose that affect and motivation are inherent in the disciplinary practices of science. Thus, we introduce notions of epistemic affect and epistemic motivation, and we illustrate how these are evident in a case study of a student we have followed from 4th to 7th grade. We consider how this perspective aligns with and contributes to research on interest (e.g., S. Hidi, 2006; S. Hidi, K. A. Renninger, & A. Krapp, 2004; C. Sansone, 2009), and we discuss implications for research and instruction in science education.

Drawing on prior work, I argue that teachers’ affective experiences in the discipline are integral to their learning how to teach the discipline. Moreover, I suggest that both affective and epistemological aspects of teachers’ experiences can serve to cultivate their epistemic empathy—the capacity for tuning into and valuing someone’s intellectual and emotional experience within an epistemic activity—in ways that support student-centered instruction. Methods: : Using a case study approach, I examine the learning journey of one preservice teacher, Keith, who after having expressed strong skepticism about responsive teaching, came to value and take up responsive teaching in his instruction. Findings: : The analysis identifies epistemological and affective dynamics in Keith’s interactions with students and in his relationship with science that fostered his epistemic empathy. By easing his worries about arriving at correct answers, Keith’s epistemic empathy shifted his attention toward supporting students’ sensemaking and nurturing their relationships with the discipline. Contribution: s: These findings highlights teachers’ affective experiences in the discipline as integral to their learning how to teach; they also call attention to epistemic empathy as an important aspect of and target for teacher learning.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2021.1936534,[theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] longitudinal study,,,,,,[construct] affect; [construct] emotion; [construct] reflection,"Epistemic Emotion Framework, Sociocultural Theory, Teacher Learning Framework,longitudinal case study, video and interview analysis,Reflective Teaching, Emotionally Responsive Pedagogy,science teacher education, teacher learning community,epistemic empathy, emotion, reflection, transformation, relational learning",[theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] longitudinal study; ; ; ; ; ; [construct] affect; [construct] emotion; [construct] reflection,,

Second, I show how a youth's social identification in the classroom is shaped by his teacher's partial accounts of how learning is arranged for in the home.

An approach for developing hypermedia case and problem-centered knowledge resources is proposed-the knowledge mediator framework (KMF)-which consists of design elements and learning activities that have specific sociocognitive theoretical and research rationales. A proof-of-concept study is then discussed; it involved high school students using a hypermedia system based on the main features of the KMF to learn neo-Darwinian evolutionary biology. Students using the experimental hypermedia system were found to change their evolutionary biology problem-solving models, and to continue to use expert-like models even 1 year after using the system. The use of the KMF to develop hypermedia learning materials in other domains and for constructive student projects is also considered. Overall, it is hoped that the framework and research outlined in this article may contribute to design and pedagogical principles for hypermedia learning tools that help students construct rich and useful understandings of challenging knowledge.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0902_2,[theory] Conceptual Change Theory; [theory] Constructivism; [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR),[method] Constructivism (Research Paradigm); [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] experimental design; [method] Knowledge Mediator Framework (KMF),[pedagogy] Case-Based Learning (CBL); [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Case-Based Instruction,[population] high school,,[subject] biology; [subject] science,[technology] hypermedia,[construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] transfer,",knowledge mediator framework (KMF),constructivism,conceptual change theory,,,design-based research,experimental study,,,,high school,science education,biology education,,,hypermedia tools,case-based learning,conceptual change,transfer,evolutionary biology,",[theory] Conceptual Change Theory; [theory] Constructivism; [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Constructivism (Research Paradigm); [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] experimental design; [method] Knowledge Mediator Framework (KMF); [pedagogy] Case-Based Learning (CBL); [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Case-Based Instruction; [population] high school; ; [subject] biology; [subject] science; [technology] hypermedia; [construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] transfer,,

However, power asymmetries between these actors can privilege the perspectives of dominant groups, while preventing non-dominant perspectives from informing conservation science.MethodsThis study investigates a workshop series intended to support young people in designing a watershed monitoring initiative rooted in their own interests with respect to a large dam removal in their community. We use interaction analysis to examine whose ideas are taken up in discussions among young people, educators, conservation professionals, and education researchers.FindingsPower dynamics that privilege the contributions of credentialed professionals over those of young people can constrain collective learning processes while simultaneously generating tensions that allow for expansive learning to occur. Facilitation practices and other pedagogical moves play an important role in either further entrenching or disrupting hierarchies between youth and community partners.ContributionOur analysis reveals how careful attention to interactional dynamics—both as a research method and as a pedagogical practice—can make visible and disrupt epistemic hierarchies in multi-stakeholder learning environments.

He makes a case for principled practical knowledge (PPK)—“principled know-how and know-why”—to fulfill this practical generative role. We argue and illustrate in this commentary that PPK as portrayed by Bereiter does not offer much practical guidance for 2 potential users: professional designers and teachers. For professional designers PPK should be further specified in order to fulfill its generative role. But even this enriched form of PPK still does not suffice to address the challenging issues of practicality teachers face.

Dia’s case illustrates how traditional norms and practices around authority and evaluation can lead to uncertainty and dissatisfaction, while Aimee’s illustrates how playful norms and practices can lead to exploration and pleasure in making.

Meanwhile, research in cognitive linguistics has identified many conceptual metaphors (CMs), metaphorical mappings between abstract concepts and experiential source domains, implicit in everyday and scientific language. However, the contributions of CMs to scientific understanding and reasoning are still not clear. This study explores the roles that CMs play in scientific problem-solving through a detailed analysis of two physical chemistry PhD students solving problems on entropy. We report evidence in support of three claims: a range of CMs are used in problem-solving enabling flexible, experiential construals of abstract scientific concepts; CMs are coordinated with one another and other resources supporting the alignment of qualitative and quantitative reasoning; use of CMs grounds abstract reasoning in a “narrative” discourse incorporating conceptions of paths, agents, and movement. We conclude that CMs should be added to the set of intuitive resources others have suggested contribute to expertise in science. This proposal is consistent with two assumptions: that cognition is embodied and that internal cognitive structures and processes interact with semiotic systems.

The analysis focused on peer responses to individuals’ attempts to manage uncertainty they experienced while engaged in collaborative efforts to design, build, and program robots and achieve assignment objectives. Patterns of peer response were established through discourse analysis of work sessions for 5 teams engaged in 2 collaborative projects. Three socially supportive peer responses and 2 unsupportive peer responses were identified. Peer interaction was influential because students relied on supportive social response to enact most of their uncertainty management strategies.

We build on Dewey’s writings about the continuity of experience, Vygotsky’s ideas of unit analysis, as well as more recent developments in continental philosophy to develop a transactional approach that involves reconceptualizing the notion of experience. In this view, experience is not something that individuals have but an analytical category that denotes the unity of whole persons, their material and social environment, and their changing transactional relations (mutual effects on each other) across time. In the 1st part of the article, we present the theory and contrast it with past and present literature on transfer. In the 2nd part, we develop the methodological implications and analyze an episode of transfer from a technology-enhanced science education curriculum in which students were presented with analogous models of scientific phenomena across different tasks.

But how do students become interested in the goals of a project? This article documents how a group of 8th-grade students participated in an architectural design project called the Antarctica Project.

Using ethnography and discourse analysis, the article investigates students' engagement with the imaginary premise and curricular tasks during the 7-week project. A case study consisting of scenes from main phases of the project shows how the students took on concerns and responsibilities associated with the figured world proposed by the Antarctica Project and how this shaped their approaches to mathematical tasks (Holland, Lachicotte, Skinner, & Cain, 1998). Participating in the figured world of Antarctica and evaluating situations within this world was important for how students used mathematics meaningfully to solve problems.

This article presents case studies of 2 groups that differed in terms of their interest in the curricular task and the level of conceptual integrity of their population models.

256,Learning in Equity-Oriented Scale-Making Projects,Jurow & Shea,2015,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article examines how new forms of learning and expertise are made to become consequential in changing communities of practice. We build on notions of scale making to understand how particular relations between practices, technologies, and people become meaningful across spatial and temporal trajectories of social action. A key assumption of our perspective is that the scale relations that give meaning to our actions are not natural but are contested in social, cultural, and political projects. Studying these contentious activities can help us understand the nature of changing participation in dynamic and historically developed practices. Using case materials from 3 groups engaged in the local food justice movement in the western United States, we illustrate their engagement in equity-oriented scale making. Defining features of this work included identifying leverage points within inequitable systems; developing strategies for remediating scale relations to include the perspectives of historically marginalized groups; and coordinating trajectories of practice across settings, activities, and time so that these interventions became increasingly consequential. We conclude with a discussion of the significance of equity-oriented scale making as a lens for organizing design efforts and for studying their implications for nondominant communities.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2015.1004677,[theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [theory] Interaction Analysis,[pedagogy] Equity-Oriented Design Research,,,,,[construct] equity; [construct] participation,"Critical Sociocultural Theory, Scale-Making Framework, Equity-Oriented Design Research,ethnographic study, interaction analysis,Equity-Oriented Project-Based Learning,community-based education, informal and out-of-school learning,equity, spatial justice, participation, community learning, transformation",[theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [theory] Interaction Analysis; [pedagogy] Equity-Oriented Design Research; ; ; ; ; [construct] equity; [construct] participation,,

260,Affordances of Collaborative Software Design Planning for Elementary Students' Science Talk,Kafai & Ching,2001,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Although educational research and practice has found many benefits of long-term and complex design activities, an issue of growing concern is that students might lose sight of science learning while diverting their attention to design aesthetics, collaborative management, and technology. A question is whether or not science is actually separate from these aspects; it may be that science permeates the design environment and is thus contexted within these other activities. To investigate this possibility we followed a classroom of 33 students, divided into 7 teams, and we examined their science discussions as they planned for creating instructional software designs. Specifically, we investigated which conversational contexts gave rise to science talk. We found that a focus on the fine-grained details of the instructional science designs themselves and the contributions of more design-experienced students played an important role in the sophistication of the science content in the planning discussions. In examining less productive contexts for science talk, we found that a conversational focus in planning discussions on collaboration and software issues, as well as the science focus of the software designs, impacted the quality of science integration. In our discussion, we address the issue of which design contexts afford opportunities for richer discourse and the implications for other project-based design activities.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1003_4,[theory] Constructionism; [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Social Constructivism,[method] Collaborative Design Research; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Discourse Analysis (DA),[pedagogy] Constructionism; [pedagogy] Design-Based Learning (DBL); [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Learning-by-Design (LBD),[population] elementary education,,[subject] science,[technology] digital tools; [technology] software engineering,[construct] collaboration,",constructionism,social constructivism,design-based learning,,,design-based research,discourse analysis,classroom study,,,,elementary education,science education,collaborative design,,,software design environments,science talk,collaboration,planning,digital tools,",[theory] Constructionism; [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Social Constructivism; [method] Collaborative Design Research; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [pedagogy] Constructionism; [pedagogy] Design-Based Learning (DBL); [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Learning-by-Design (LBD); [population] elementary education; ; [subject] science; [technology] digital tools; [technology] software engineering; [construct] collaboration,,

262,An ecological paradigm of interdisciplinary learning: Implications for design,Kali,2024,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"In this commentary, I offer my insights from the Special Issue—Beyond disciplinary engagement: researching the ecologies of interdisciplinary learning—which, in my view, reframes interdisciplinarity. In contrast to the cognitivist paradigm—where research is largely concerned with learning processes that lead to an individual’s cognitive interdisciplinary learning outcome—in the ecological paradigm research is primarily concerned with the interdisciplinary learning processes that occur within groups. To address a concern regarding the usefulness of design principles in this framing, I use an approach for extending the applicability of design principles by augmenting them with designers’ dilemmas and solutions in various contexts. Three main dilemmas are discussed: (1) How to ensure students have access to disciplinary knowledge and epistemic resources, as they embark on the interdisciplinary work? (2) How to support the fine-grained socio-material-cultural processes involved in interdisciplinary learning between diverse learners, levels and/or disciplinary expertise? (3) How to build on, but also push the boundaries of existing infrastructures to develop new routines, social networks, physical and digital infrastructures to accommodate interdisciplinary learning from K-12 through higher education? A synthesis of the studies’ array of solutions is proposed as a preliminary roadmap for the design of ecologically-oriented interdisciplinary learning environments.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2024.2354152,[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Ecological Paradigm; [theory] Learning Ecologies,[method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Ecological Perspective; [method] Meta-Analysis,[pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR),,[setting] higher education; [setting] K–12 education,,,[construct] collaboration,",ecological paradigm,design-based research,learning ecologies,,,conceptual synthesis,design principle analysis,,,,K–12 education,higher education,interdisciplinary design,,,design principles,socio-material processes,infrastructures,interdisciplinarity,collaboration,",[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Ecological Paradigm; [theory] Learning Ecologies; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Ecological Perspective; [method] Meta-Analysis; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); ; [setting] higher education; [setting] K–12 education; ; ; [construct] collaboration,,

CitationKapur, 2008). We then report findings from an ongoing program of research on PF in mathematical problem solving in 3 Singapore public schools with significantly different mathematical ability profiles, ranging from average to lower ability. In the 1st study, 7th-grade mathematics students from intact classes experienced 1 of 2 conditions: (a) PF, in which students collaboratively solved complex problems on average speed without any instructional support or scaffolds up until a teacher-led consolidation; or (b) direct instruction (DI), in which the teacher provided strong instructional support, scaffolding, and feedback. Findings: suggested that although PF students generated a diversity of linked representations and methods for solving the complex problems, they were ultimately unsuccessful in their problem-solving efforts. Yet despite seemingly failing in their problem-solving efforts, PF students significantly outperformed DI students on the well-structured and complex problems on the posttest. They also demonstrated greater representation flexibility in solving average speed problems involving graphical representations, a representation that was not targeted during instruction. The 2nd and 3rd studies, conducted in schools with students of significantly lower mathematical ability, largely replicated the findings of the 1st study.

PF students generated solutions to a complex problem targeting the concept of variance that they had not learned yet before receiving instruction on the targeted concept. VF students evaluated the solutions generated by PF students before receiving the same instruction. Student-generated solutions were either suboptimal or incorrect, and in this sense can be conceived as failed problem-solving attempts. Although there was no difference on self-reported engagement, PF students reported significantly greater mental effort and interest in knowing the canonical solution to the problem than VF students. When preexisting differences in general ability, math ability, and prior knowledge were controlled, PF students outperformed VF students on conceptual understanding and transfer without compromising procedural fluency. These results suggest that when learning a new math concept, people learn better from their own failed solutions than those of others provided appropriate instruction on the targeted concept is given after the generation or evaluation activity.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2013.819000,[theory] Transfer Theory,[method] experimental design,[pedagogy] Problem-Based Learning (PBL); [pedagogy] Scaffolding,,,[subject] mathematics,,[construct] failure; [construct] metacognition; [construct] scaffolding; [construct] transfer,"Productive Failure Framework, Constructivist Learning Theory, Transfer Theory,experimental design, quantitative analysis,Productive Failure (PF), Problem-Based Learning (PBL),mathematics education, high school classrooms,failure, preparation for learning, transfer, metacognition, scaffolding",[theory] Transfer Theory; [method] experimental design; [pedagogy] Problem-Based Learning (PBL); [pedagogy] Scaffolding; ; ; [subject] mathematics; ; [construct] failure; [construct] metacognition; [construct] scaffolding; [construct] transfer,,

We describe a software architecture called Guided Social Simulation (GuSS). GuSS combines a simulation in which students can practice social skills with guidance that enhances the simulated experience. One of the applications of GuSS, called YELLO, teaches how to sell Yellow Pages advertising. YELLO is described in detail. The social simulation and guidance components of GuSS each present a set of technical and theoretical challenges. We discuss both sets. In discussing the techniques we use for constructing a social simulation, we emphasize the mechanisms that implement social agents as simple social planners. We then focus on one particular guidance component of GuSS—the storyteller.

This necessitates providing learners with adequate support to navigate their uncertainties effectively. However, achieving this requires a deeper understanding of the factors influencing learners’ uncertainty management processes.MethodIn this paper, we analyze learners’ framing of uncertain situations in collaborative engineering design tasks. Using the case study method, we explore two framing dimensions—epistemological and positional—to understand their impact on collaborative uncertainty management processes. Specifically, we examine how learners’ framing dynamically shifts during uncertainty management activities by analyzing two contrasting cases from a sixth-grade classroom where groups tackled an engineering design problem, employing interaction analysis.FindingsLearners’ epistemological and positional framings are intertwined, collectively influencing their own and their team members’ uncertainty management actions. Additionally, contextual factors such as mentor intervention, early success, affect induced by prolonged failure, and time constraints can prompt shifts in learners’ framing, both in productive and unproductive manners.ContributionThe paper provides nuanced insights into how learners’ evolving epistemological orientations and positioning influence uncertainty management, offering practical insights into supporting learners’ uncertainty management processes in problem-solving contexts such as engineering design.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2024.2312163,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,

While formative assessment is widely recognized as a process for supporting learning, less is known about how it can be enacted in culturally and linguistically sustaining ways.MethodsDrawing on a case study of a science and engineering teacher and three multilingual girls from Afro-Brazilian and Portuguese backgrounds in a summer STE(A)M program at a newcomer school in the Northeastern United States, we apply the CLSA framework to analyze moment-to-moment interactions and examine the nature, form, and function of the teacher’s discursive and embodied moves. We analyze how these moves become consequential in sustaining students’ disciplinary engagement through CLSA-aligned practices such as asking questions, providing feedback, and interpreting students’ actions.FindingsFindings demonstrate how CLSA, when enacted through a proleptic belief in students’ competencies and relational attunement to their translanguaging, embodied interaction, and epistemic flow, surfaces forms of competencies, foundational to STEM disciplines.ContributionThe study offers insights for how the CLSA approach can serve as a relational and dignity-oriented pedagogical process that recognizes and sustains the brilliance of youth historically marginalized in STEM.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2025.2529170,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,
269,Inquiry as a Members’ Phenomenon: Young Children as Competent Inquirers,Keifert & Stevens,2018,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Understanding children’s inquiry often draws on exogenous understanding (i.e., scientists’ inquiry, classroom expectations) without first understanding inquiry in children’s everyday lives. In contrast, we examine young children’s inquiry in their families to better understand their competent engagement in inquiry. Specifically, we develop an endogenous representation of inquiry as a members’ phenomenon (IMP)—a representation formulated by participants in the course of their own activity. IMP highlights key moments in inquiry—beginning by orienting to inquiry, making progress by drawing on sensemaking resources, and orienting to ending inquiry. This representation also allows us to recognize evidence of young children’s competence in managing interactional, affective, and epistemic challenges inherent in these key moments of inquiry; the diverse array of sensemaking resources through which children address those challenges; and a range of children’s interests and concerns addressed within their inquiry. Furthermore, IMP provides a prism for reconceptualizing learning from learners’ perspective: attending to how participants orient to a moment of inquiry, inquire together, and come to what counts to them as a satisfactory end to their inquiry. This representation of inquiry is an important step in basic learning sciences research and informative for the design of science and other domain learning environments.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2018.1528448,[theory] Ethnomethodology; [theory] Practice Theory; [theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] Interaction / Video Analysis,[pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL),,,,,[construct] competence; [construct] discourse; [construct] participation,"Ethnomethodology, Interactional Sociocultural Theory, Inquiry-as-Practice Framework,microethnography, video interaction analysis,Inquiry-Based Learning, Child-Centered Learning,early childhood science, informal and home-based settings,inquiry, participation, competence, membership, discourse",[theory] Ethnomethodology; [theory] Practice Theory; [theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL); ; ; ; ; [construct] competence; [construct] discourse; [construct] participation,,

Analysis of the discourse in the discussions showed that 8 different rhetorical moves, or argument stratagems, were used by most groups of children, whereas 3 other stratagems were used by 1 group. The use of argument stratagems snowballed; that is, once an argument stratagem emerged in a discussion, it tended to spread to other children in the Web group, and the likelihood that it would occur again remained high over the course of the discussion. Most stratagems began to spread when initiated by other children but not when introduced by the adult moderator. Children were eager to participate and displayed a high rate of participation in discussions with Webmates from distant classrooms.

The more advanced of the 15 participants displayed knowledge-dependent representational variability, fine-tuned their diagrams to the immediate reasoning task, and systematically used their fine-tuned diagrams as ""tools to think with"" while reasoning. These results suggest that more advanced pictorial skills and conceptual knowledge coevolve or mutually influence one another in the development of understanding of a subcellular biological process.

This essay makes three points: (a) Stokes had a broader view that also considered the temporal flow between and among the different cells in his famous diagram; (b) Stokes argued against the relative valuation of either type of research (basic or applied); and (c) the learning sciences currently contain exemplars of all four of the cells in Stokes’s famous 2 × 2 matrix, and this diversity has enriched the field, and can continue to do so, as long as work in Pasteur’s quadrant is not viewed as the only worthwhile type of learning sciences research.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2019.1570517,[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR),[method] Design-Based Research (DBR),[pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR),,,,,,"Pasteur’s Quadrant Framework, Cognitive Science, Design-Based Research,theoretical essay, meta-analysis of research traditions,Research–Practice Integration, Scientific Inquiry,learning sciences, field overview,translational research, integration, basic vs. applied science, methodology, theory-building",[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); ; ; ; ; ,,
276,The Real Story Behind Story Problems: Effects of Representations on Quantitative Reasoning,Koedinger & Nathan,2004,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article explores how differences in problem representations change both the performance and underlying cognitive processes of beginning algebra students engaged in quantitative reasoning. Contrary to beliefs held by practitioners and researchers in mathematics education, students were more successful solving simple algebra story problems than solving mathematically equivalent equations. Contrary to some views of situated cognition, this result is not simply a consequence of situated world knowledge facilitating problem-solving performance, but rather a consequence of student difficulties with comprehending the formal symbolic representation of quantitative relations. We draw on analyses of students' strategies and errors as the basis for a cognitive process explanation of when, why, and how differences in problem representation affect problem solving. We conclude that differences in external representations can affect performance and learning when one representation is easier to comprehend than another or when one representation elicits more reliable and meaningful solution strategies than another.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1207/s15327809jls1302_1,[theory] Cognitive Psychology,[method] experimental design; [method] statistical analysis,[pedagogy] Problem-Based Learning (PBL),,,[subject] mathematics,,[construct] problem solving; [construct] representations,"Cognitive Psychology, Representational Theory,experimental design, statistical analysis,Problem-Based Learning (PBL),mathematics, secondary education,representations, reasoning, problem solving",[theory] Cognitive Psychology; [method] experimental design; [method] statistical analysis; [pedagogy] Problem-Based Learning (PBL); ; ; [subject] mathematics; ; [construct] problem solving; [construct] representations,,

We propose the concept of fertile zones of cultural encounter as a way of overcoming these learning difficulties. This pedagogical approach aims to bridge the gap between cultures by designing interventions that are appreciated by members of both cultures, yet also guide the student to engage in the practices of the professional culture. The learning difficulties are demonstrated by a detailed analysis of episodes taken from an advanced high school computer science course in concurrency.

282,Problem-Based Learning Meets Case-Based Reasoning in the Middle-School Science Classroom: Putting Learning by Design(tm) Into Practice,Kolodner et al.,2003,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article tells the story of the design of Learning by Design(tm) (LBD), a project-based inquiry approach to science learning with roots in case-based reasoning and problem-based learning, pointing out the theoretical contributions of both, classroom issues that arose upon piloting a first attempt, ways we addressed those challenges, lessons learned about promoting learning taking a project-based inquiry approach, and lessons learned about taking a theory-based approach to designing learning environments. LBD uses what we know about cognition to fashion a learning environment appropriate to deeply learning science concepts and skills and their applicability, in parallel with learning cognitive, social, learning, and communication skills. Our goal, in designing LBD, was to lay the foundation in middle school for students to be successful thinkers, learners, and decisionmakers throughout their lives and especially to help them begin to learn the science they need to know to thrive in the modern world. LBD has students learn science in the context of achieving design-and-build challenges. Included in LBD's framework is a set of ritualized and sequenced activities that help teachers and students acclimate to the culture of a highly collaborative, learner-centered, inquiry-oriented, and design-based classroom. Those ritualized activities help teachers and students learn the practices of scientists, engineers, and group members in ways that they can use outside the classroom. LBD is carefully crafted to promote deep and lasting learning, but we have learned that careful crafting is not enough for success in putting a collaborative inquiry approach into practice. Also essential are fostering a collaborative classroom culture in which students want to be engaged in deep learning and where the teacher sees herself as both a learner and a facilitator of learning, trusts that with her help the students can learn, and enthusiastically assumes the roles she needs to take on.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1204_2,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,

We argue that a project should progress through four steps: (a) making explicit the instructional requirements that serve as design goals for the project; (b) performing a detailed study of current educational practice with regard to these goals; (c) developing a specification based on the identified requirements/limitations of the instructional setting and the known capabilities of the technology; and (d) producing an implementation that allows for local adaptation to instructional practice. We propose six principles of effective learning and instruction, which we view to be the critical features of learning in complex and ill-structured fields. Next, a detailed case study is presented based on the preclinical training given to medical students in the first 2 years of medical school. The problems of providing adequate instruction in the preclinical years are described, as is an instructional method known as problem-based learning (PBL) that has been introduced to redress some of these problems. The product of this design process is a set of specifications for technical augmentations that we believe will serve not only the needs of PBL but also those of other methods of instruction that depend on collaborative, case-based, or student-centered learning.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0303_2,[theory] Cognitive Apprenticeship; [theory] Situated Learning,[method] conceptual modeling; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR),[pedagogy] Cognitive Apprenticeship; [pedagogy] Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL),,,,[technology] computer-supported learning,,",cognitive apprenticeship,situated learning,instructional systems design,,,design research,theoretical synthesis,case illustration,,,,computer-supported learning environments,educational technology,,,instructional principles,technology integration,cognitive tools,learning support,",[theory] Cognitive Apprenticeship; [theory] Situated Learning; [method] conceptual modeling; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Cognitive Apprenticeship; [pedagogy] Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL); ; ; ; [technology] computer-supported learning; ,,

299,Optical Pulsars and Black Arrows: Discoveries as Occasioned Productions,Koschmann & Zemel,2009,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The current article represents a methodological proposal. It seeks to address the question of how one might recognize a discovery as a discovery without knowing in advance what is available to be discovered. We propose a solution and demonstrate it using data from a study previously reported by J. CitationRoschelle (1992). Roschelle investigated 2 students' developing understandings of certain abstract features of Newtonian mechanics while working within a computer-based microworld, the Envisioning Machine. We employ an approach we term discovery as occasioned production to reexamine his data. Such an approach proceeds stepwise from the identification of some matter discovered, working backward to see just where that matter entered the conversation and then, finally, tracing from that point forward to illuminate how the proposal for a possible discovery was ultimately transformed into a discovery achieved. The notion of “evident vagueness,” borrowed from H. Garfinkel, M. Lynch, and D. CitationLivingston's (1981) account of the discovery of an optical pulsar, emerges as an important feature of our analysis. Following H. CitationGarfinkel (2002), we present our findings as a “tutorial problem” and offer a suggestion for how a program of practice studies in the learning sciences might be pursued.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400902797966,[theory] Ethnomethodology; [theory] Science and Technology Studies (STS),[method] conversation analysis,,,,[subject] physics,,[construct] interaction; [construct] meaning making,"Ethnomethodology, Conversation Analysis, Laboratory Studies,ethnomethodological analysis, video re-analysis, conversation analysis,Discovery Learning,physics education, computer-based simulation environments,discovery, interaction, conversation, social construction, meaning-making",[theory] Ethnomethodology; [theory] Science and Technology Studies (STS); [method] conversation analysis; ; ; ; [subject] physics; ; [construct] interaction; [construct] meaning making,,

301,The Roles of Representations and Tools in the Chemistry Laboratory and Their Implications for Chemistry Learning,Kozma et al.,2000,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"In this historical and observational study, we describe how scientists use representations and tools in the chemistry laboratory, and we derive implications from these findings for the design of educational environments. In our observations we found that chemists use representations and tools to mediate between the physical substances that they study and the aperceptual chemical entities and processes that underlie and account for the material qualities of these physical substances. There are 2 important, interrelated aspects of this mediational process: the material and the social. The 1st emphasizes the surface features of both physical phenomena and symbolic representations, features that can be perceived and manipulated. The 2nd underscores the inherently semiotic, rhetorical process whereby chemists claim that representations stand for unseen entities and processes. In elaborating on our analyses, we � Examine the historical origins and contemporary practices of representation use in one particular domain-chemistry-to look at how developments in the design of representations advance the development of a scientific community, as well as the understanding of scientists engaged in laboratory practice. � Examine representations spontaneously generated by chemists, as well as those generated by their tools or instruments, and look at how scientists-individually and collaboratively-coordinate these 2 types of representations with the material substances of their investigations to understand the structures and processes that underlie them. � Draw implications from the study of scientists to make recommendations for the design of learning environments and symbol systems that can support the use of representations by students to understand the structures and processes that underlie their scientific investigations and to engage them in the practices of knowledge-building communities.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0902_1,[theory] Constructivism; [theory] Situated Cognition,[method] Constructivism (Research Paradigm); [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Mixed Methods; [method] participant observation,,[population] high school,[setting] classrooms,[subject] chemistry; [subject] science,[technology] data visualization; [technology] visualization tools,[construct] representations,",representational competence,situated cognition,constructivism,,,mixed methods,classroom observation,discourse analysis,,,,high school,chemistry education,science education,,,visualization tools,lab technologies,representational reasoning,molecular modeling,inquiry learning,representations",[theory] Constructivism; [theory] Situated Cognition; [method] Constructivism (Research Paradigm); [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Mixed Methods; [method] participant observation; ; [population] high school; [setting] classrooms; [subject] chemistry; [subject] science; [technology] data visualization; [technology] visualization tools; [construct] representations,,

Our goal is to describe realistically what middle school students do and where they have difficulties in their first encounters with inquiry learning. We report findings from case studies of 8 students as they designed and carried out their own investigations during 2 projects that spanned several months. We detail how students asked questions, planned and designed investigations and procedures, constructed apparatus, carried out their work, interpreted data and drew conclusions, and presented the findings. We discuss how collaboration among group members and support from the teacher influenced this process. The findings indicate that middle school students were thoughtful in designing investigations and in planning procedures; for instance, they thought about controls, about samples, and about how to organize data collection. However, the cases also reveal areas of weakness, such as failures to focus on the scientific merit of questions generated and to systematically collect and analyze data and draw conclusions. Teacher structuring and questioning were crucial in encouraging students to be thoughtful about the substantive aspects of inquiry. Overall, these findings can help curriculum developers and science educators in their attempts to design instruction to improve the inquiry process.",https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315799285-3/inquiry-project-based-science-classrooms-initial-attempts-middle-school-students-joseph-krajcik-phyllis-blumenfeld-ronald-marx-kristin-bass-jennifer-fredricks-elliot-soloway,,[method] Case Study Research,,,,[subject] science,,,", inquiry learning,,, case study,,,, science learning,middle school students,collaboration among group members,,, students' experience,first encounters with inquiry learning,",; [method] Case Study Research; ; ; ; [subject] science; ; ,,

This article synthesizes and builds on existing frameworks to identify essential characteristics of students’ mechanistic reasoning across scientific content areas. We argue that these characteristics can be represented as epistemic heuristics, or ideas about how to direct one’s intellectual work, that implicitly guide mechanistic reasoning. We use this framework to characterize middle school students’ written explanatory accounts of two phenomena in different science content areas using these heuristics. We demonstrate evidence of heuristics in students’ accounts and show that the use of the heuristics was related to but distinct from science content knowledge. We describe how the heuristics allowed us to characterize and compare the mechanistic sophistication of account construction across science content areas. This framework captures elements of a crosscutting practical epistemology that may support students in directing the construction of mechanistic accounts across content areas over time, and it allows us to characterize that progress.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2018.1510404,[theory] Model-Based Reasoning,,,,,,,[construct] explanation,"Epistemic Heuristics Framework, Mechanistic Reasoning, Knowledge-Building Theory,framework synthesis, written artifact analysis,Model-Based Reasoning, Epistemic Practice Scaffolding,middle school science education, classroom-based inquiry,epistemic heuristics, mechanistic reasoning, explanation, crosscutting concepts, scientific practice",[theory] Model-Based Reasoning; ; ; ; ; ; ; [construct] explanation,,

Working from an ecological account of perception-action, we propose that a methodology for understanding situated action should afford the instructional designer (often the classroom teacher), the methodologist, and the problem solver opportunities to co-construct coupling dynamics that operate on multiple space and time scales including ""real time."" With this goal in mind, we propose the use of the Jasper Planning Assistant (JPA), an online learning and assessment system that becomes part of the design-learning-research situation and serves as a scaffold for the learner. Through analysis of log-file data produced by the JPA, we illustrate that a methodology for situated action should be neither a purely quantitative nor qualitative account, but rather an inscription-an emergent visualization of the coupling dynamics between a student and his or her environment. We conclude that ideally this emergent inscription should reveal the multiple space times in which problem solving is occurring, yet be reductive in such a way as to create affordances for future action: Methodology should have functional value.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS10-1-2_7,[theory] Ecological Psychology,[method] conceptual modeling; [method] Ecological Validity,,,,,,[construct] ecological validity,",ecological psychology,situated action,Gibsonian affordances,,,methodological analysis,theoretical synthesis,,,,learning sciences,cognitive science,,,affordances,perception–action coupling,ecological validity,research methodology,",[theory] Ecological Psychology; [method] conceptual modeling; [method] Ecological Validity; ; ; ; ; ; [construct] ecological validity,,
305,Changing Patterns of Scaffolding and Autonomy During Individual Music Lessons: A Mixed Methods Approach,Kupers et al.,2016,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Learning implies change. Inside and outside schools, we aim for students to change into people with more skills and knowledge as well as with a growing sense of agency and responsibility. Furthermore, education itself is subject to constant change. In this article, we examine change in 3 case studies in the context of individual music lessons from a complex dynamic systems approach. Three beginning string instrument students and their teacher were followed for 18 months (28 lessons per dyad) by means of video observations. We combine cluster analyses on longitudinal data with qualitative illustrations of moment-to-moment teacher–student transactions to gain insight into how and why change in teaching and learning occurs. The 3 cases show distinct profiles of change: the development of strong suboptimal attractor states, the emergence of optimal attractor states, and a profile that is characterized by falling back into suboptimal attractor states. We discuss how optimal and suboptimal learning and teaching trajectories can unfold over time and how a mixed methods approach can provide valuable new insights for both practice and future research.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2016.1259624,[theory] Dynamic Systems Theory,[method] longitudinal study; [method] Microgenetic Method,[pedagogy] Scaffolding,,,,,[construct] autonomy; [construct] creativity; [construct] scaffolding,"Dynamic Systems Theory, Creativity Theory, Scaffolding Framework,microgenetic analysis, longitudinal study,Inquiry-Based Creativity, Guided Discovery,primary education, classroom inquiry projects,scaffolding, autonomy, creativity, dynamics, co-regulation",[theory] Dynamic Systems Theory; [method] longitudinal study; [method] Microgenetic Method; [pedagogy] Scaffolding; ; ; ; ; [construct] autonomy; [construct] creativity; [construct] scaffolding,,

In this research, we investigate a different route to analogical insight. We suggest that mutual alignment-that is, comparison between 2 partially understood situations-can act to promote comprehension and abstraction. We presented participants with 2 analogous scenarios depicting heat flow. They were given processing tasks that varied in the degree to which comparison was required. We then measured insight into the common structure in 3 ways. Participants were asked to (a) specify differences between the 2 pictured scenarios, (b) write scenario descriptions, and (c) rate the similarity of the 2 scenarios. The results show that carrying out comparison promotes greater insight into the common causal structure, but only when the comparison is intensive. The best results were obtained when participants were asked to jointly interpret the scenarios and to list specific correspondences. In a second experiment designed to further pinpoint the source of the comparison advantage, participants were asked to make correspondences between the elements of the 2 scenarios.

309,Productive failure and learning through argumentation: Building a bridge between two research traditions to understand the process of peer learning,Larrain et al.,2022,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Empirical evidence demonstrates the effect of productive failure (Kapur, 2008) on disciplinary knowledge. However, there is no clear theoretical explanation for why this is the case. Empirical evidence on argumentation and education shows the impact of curricular embedded deliberative argumentation on learning. However, these two trends of research have been mainly isolated, with insufficient synergy. Through the analysis of a group of sixth-graders collaborating around problems of natural selection, the aim of this paper is the theoretical exploration of the process of learning in productive failure designs through a focus on argumentative peer dialogue. The paper proposes an articulation of these two fields of research (productive failure and argumentation), which sheds light on both the learning dynamics in productive failure settings and the relevant insights for argumentative designs. The new possibilities for empirical research on learning through peer interaction opened up by these interconnected fields of research are proposed and discussed.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2022.2120398,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,
310,How Children Individualize Numerical Routines: Elements of a Discursive Theory in Making,Lavie & Sfard,2019,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Conceptualizing numbers as discursive constructs generated in, and for the sake of, communication, we investigated the development of the numerical discourse of Milo, a boy who was 2 years and 8 months old when we first met him and whom we then followed for 18 months. Our analyses of the child’s evolving responses to the question “Where is there more X?” (WiTM) corroborated the basic theoretical tenet, according to which numerical thinking begins in our culture with the independent appearance of (1) the quantitative–non-numerical discourse and (2) numerical–non-quantitative discourse. In Milo’s case, these two discourses, although constantly evolving, remained separate for months. A number of clearly distinguishable developments preceded the eventual consolidation of the independent numerical and quantitative “rituals” the child performed in response to WiTM-question into one compound routine of quantitative–numerical comparison. It is at this point that the numerical and quantitative ways of thinking began coalescing into a single discourse and the initial binary relation of order gave rise to the unary relation of cardinality. All this is summarized in a three-stage model of the development of numerical discourse. Three additional case studies that corroborated this model are reported briefly.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2019.1646650,[theory] Commognitive Theory; [theory] Learning Trajectories Framework,[method] Case Study Research; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA),,,,[subject] mathematics,,[construct] communication; [construct] discourse; [construct] participation,"Commognitive Theory, Discursive Psychology,discourse analysis, case study,Mathematical Discourse Pedagogy, Individualized Learning,mathematics education, elementary school classrooms,discourse, routine individualization, participation, communication, learning trajectories",[theory] Commognitive Theory; [theory] Learning Trajectories Framework; [method] Case Study Research; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); ; ; ; [subject] mathematics; ; [construct] communication; [construct] discourse; [construct] participation,,

T1D treatment requires frequent measurement and recording of numerical data about blood sugar concentration, nutritional intake, and insulin dosage at the child’s home, at school, and at other activities. We analyze coordination work between family members and others involved in the care of children with T1D using the lens of distributed cognition, and we introduce the notion of a data catchment to refer to the pathways of data flow and information storage within and between multiple agents and spaces. Interviews and observations reveal three main features of storage and use in data catchments: First, there is a great variability in how data move and are retained to enable communication between family members and others. Second, families tended to focus more on individual data points and less on aggregate readings despite some indications of ability to narrate through aggregate readings. Third, families engage in recurrent conversations and sometimes use novel artifacts to make numerical values meaningful to children with T1D. Implications for understanding this space of practice as constituting a data catchment are discussed.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2019.1666011,[theory] Distributed Cognition,[method] participant observation,,,,,,[construct] collaboration; [construct] coordination; [construct] data literacy; [construct] distributed cognition; [construct] meaning making; [construct] sensemaking,"Distributed Cognition, Sociotechnical Systems Theory,ethnographic observation, interview study,Everyday Data Practices, Family-Based Learning,health and data literacy education, family and home contexts,data literacy, distributed cognition, health practices, coordination, sensemaking",[theory] Distributed Cognition; [method] participant observation; ; ; ; ; ; [construct] collaboration; [construct] coordination; [construct] data literacy; [construct] distributed cognition; [construct] meaning making; [construct] sensemaking,,
315,Learning sciences and learning engineering: A natural or artificial distinction?,Lee,2022,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"“Learning engineering” has gained popularity as a term connected to the work of learning sciences. However, the nature of that connection is not entirely clear. For some, learning engineering represents distinct, industry-inspired practices enabled by data abundance and digital platformization of learning technologies. That view is presented as one where learning engineers apply learning research that has resided in experimental studies. For others, learning engineering should refer to the use of the full breadth of knowledge developed within the learning sciences research community. This second view is more inclusive of the fundamentally situated, design-oriented, and real-world commitments that are the backbone of the learning sciences, as reflected in this journal. The two views differ even as far as whether the academic field is labeled “learning science” or “learning sciences”. This article examines and articulates these differences. It also argues that without course correction, many who identify with learning engineering will conduct technology-supported learning improvement work that, at its own risk, will neglect the full and necessary scope of what has already been and continues to be discovered in the learning sciences. Moreover, it behooves all to consider recently elevated, but deeply fundamental questions being asked in the learning sciences about what is important to learn and toward what ends. With some more clarity around what is actually encompassed by the learning sciences and how all interested in design and educational improvement can build upon that knowledge, we can make greater collective progress to understanding and supporting human learning.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2022.2100705,[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Epistemology; [theory] Systems Theory,[method] conceptual modeling; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR),[pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR),,,,,[construct] epistemology; [construct] systems thinking,"Learning Engineering Framework, Design-Based Research, Systems Thinking,conceptual analysis, comparative framework analysis,Learning Engineering Pedagogy, Evidence-Based Design,learning sciences research, meta-disciplinary discourse,engineering design, interdisciplinarity, epistemology, scalability, design ethics",[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Epistemology; [theory] Systems Theory; [method] conceptual modeling; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); ; ; ; ; [construct] epistemology; [construct] systems thinking,,
316,Reflective Teaching of Logo,Lehrer et al.,1999,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"A long-term instructional experiment assessed the cognitive consequences of reflective teaching practices, compared to inquiry teaching practices, on the acquisition and transfer of Logo computer programming for 2nd- and 5th-grade students. Inquiry teaching represented previous ""best practices"" in which teachers elicited predictions, asked leading questions, and assisted students when they encountered programming impasses. Reflective teaching modified inquiry teaching by explicit encouragement of a design stance where students assumed roles as potential designers of Logo as well as actual roles as the designers of their own programs for peer audiences. Other tools for reflection included writing summaries of their programming experiences, using programming templates, and working with ""microworlds"" that helped students objectify their experiences with Logo. Multiple levels (syntactic, semantic, schematic, strategic, and beliefs) of Logo knowledge were measured during and after instruction. Between-group differences over repeated measures consistently favored the group participating in reflective instruction. However, rather than simple differences on every measure, the pattern of mean differences over time was most consistent with Mayer's (1985) proposal of a chain of cognitive consequences regulating the acquisition of Logo. Moreover, participation in the reflective context facilitated general transfer of specific skills like debugging and summarization for both grades, but no differences in general transfer were observed between instructional conditions for skills not explicitly targeted for instruction. Children participating in the reflective context developed beliefs about programming practices that were tightly coupled with their performances. This tight coupling underscores the reciprocal relation between the social and the individual in the acquisition and transfer of cognitive skill.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0802_3,[theory] Constructionism; [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR),[method] Case Study Research; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR),[pedagogy] Constructionism; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Reflective Practice,[population] elementary education,,[subject] computer science / programming; [subject] mathematics,[technology] computer-based instruction,[construct] reflection,",constructionism,reflective practice,teacher learning,,,design-based research,classroom intervention,case study,,,,elementary education,computer-based learning,mathematics education,,,programming environments,Logo,reflection,teacher development,design learning,",[theory] Constructionism; [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Case Study Research; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Constructionism; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Reflective Practice; [population] elementary education; ; [subject] computer science / programming; [subject] mathematics; [technology] computer-based instruction; [construct] reflection,,

However, studies in out-of-school contexts show students building thematic interpretations that include positive and negative elements. These conflicting findings suggest that some challenges of thematic interpretation lie not in students’ interpretive limitations but in school-based discourses that define thematic interpretation. In this study, students constructed thematic interpretations with sentence stems using everyday interpretive language, such as “Reading this story suggests the world can be a place where _____.” With no additional instruction, experimental groups constructed more thematic interpretations and made fewer happiness-bound interpretations than a comparison group. Results suggest that students are more capable of thematic interpretation than some research indicates and that everyday interpretive language may help disrupt students’ school-based framing of thematic interpretation.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2018.1485023,,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] experimental design,,,,,,[construct] discourse; [construct] meaning making,"Transactional Reading Theory, Sociocultural Theory of Interpretation, Reader-Response Theory,experimental design, discourse analysis,Literary Interpretation Pedagogy, Language Scaffolding,English language arts, high school classrooms,thematic interpretation, discourse, everyday language, meaning-making, framing",; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] experimental design; ; ; ; ; ; [construct] discourse; [construct] meaning making,,

The term appropriation, borrowed from scholars in linguistics and education, was chosen to capture this broader sense of productive learning that sits at the nexus of disciplinary engagement and identity. Appropriation implies deep conceptual understanding, but it also involves a reflexive process of transforming scientific discourse in a way that is authentic and personal. The core aim of this article is to turn the term appropriation into a theoretical construct by means of an analytic process of defining, operationalizing, and testing the definition against student interview and classroom data. Five discourse markers for operationalizing appropriation were discovered through this process. Appropriation, in our study, implies students’ discourse is (A) an expression of a personal “signature“ idea, (B) grounded in the discipline, (C) thick, in that it involves a metacognitive and epistemological dimension, (D) non-incidental, in the sense of being consistently used throughout classroom activities, and (E) a carrier of social relationships, in that it positions the student within classroom.

These students often have qualitatively different ways of processing information, meaning that standard instructional approaches may not be effective. In this study I present a case study of a student with a mathematical learning disability for whom standard instruction on fractions had been ineffective. With regard to theory, I draw on Lev Vygotsky’s framing of disability and then use Anna Sfard’s conceptualization of mathematics as a discourse to design a fraction re-mediation that provided a bridge from the student’s discourse to the canonical mathematics discourse. This bridging discourse was used in 5 videotaped re-mediation sessions with the case study student. A fine-grained analysis of the re-mediation sessions traced the ways in which the student’s discourse shifted over time, which enabled her to solve problems she had previously been unable to solve.

322,A Collective Case Study of the Use of ICT in Economics Courses: A Sociocultural Approach,Lim & Barnes,2005,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Based on a collective case study of the use of an economics Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) tutorial-based package, WinEcon, in 3 British schools, this article examines the activity structures that exist in ICT-mediated lessons situated within their broader sociocultural contexts. Activity theory and its highly developed ideas of the sociocultural conceptions of human nature and cognition are adopted to frame the study. By drawing together Gifford's (1997) mediated learning model and Cole's (1995) culture as garden metaphor, the former captures the activities mediated by students, teachers, ICT, and non-ICT tools in the course, and these are situated in the latter's broader sociocultural settings of the school, education system, and society at large. Although the article provides an account of the use of WinEcon in economics courses, its emphases are on the issues and problems of ICT integration: course objectives, teaching and learning tools, participants, sociocultural constraints, activities, and design of the learning environment. Consistent with other studies of ICT integration, there are 2 interrelated points for consideration regarding the use of ICT in enculturating students to think ""in an economics way"": (a) pivotal role of the teacher in the design of the learning environment and (b) object of activities, sociocultural constraints, and the enculturation process.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls1404_2,[theory] (Cultural-Historical) Activity Theory (CHAT); [theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] interview methods; [method] participant observation,[pedagogy] Collaborative Learning,,[setting] higher education,,,[construct] collaboration; [construct] mediation; [construct] observation; [construct] participation,"Sociocultural Theory, Activity Theory,case study research, interviews, observation,Technology-Enhanced Learning, Collaborative Learning,economics education, higher education, ICT tools,technology integration, collaboration, mediation, participation",[theory] (Cultural-Historical) Activity Theory (CHAT); [theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] interview methods; [method] participant observation; [pedagogy] Collaborative Learning; ; [setting] higher education; ; ; [construct] collaboration; [construct] mediation; [construct] observation; [construct] participation,,

We compared test results using verbatim, paraphrased, and transfer items. We also carried out in-depth analyses of dialogs in the discussions.FindingsIn three separate experiments, we found that the discussion groups scored significantly higher than the review group.

The aim of the study is to describe and discuss a type of interactional sequence that we refer to as dark matter, the ordinary backdrop to the extraordinary sequences that are easily recognizable as clear-cut instances of learning. Although this work is downplayed in the research literature, describing it is critical to properly understanding lab work as an educational practice. With a focus on the negotiation of disciplined perception, we analyze a number of episodes wherein a pair of students and an instructor struggle with the construction and interpretation of a graph depicting a linear relationship between force and acceleration. We demonstrate an intimate interplay between how the students display their problems and understandings and how the instructor tries to make the subject matter content visible and thus learnable.

325,The Redirection: An Indicator of How Teachers Respond to Student Thinking,Lineback,2014,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Responsive teaching occurs when teachers take up and respond to their students’ ideas during instruction (J. L. Pierson, 2008). Although responsive teaching is gaining recognition as an effective strategy for encouraging student learning, few methods of analysis are capable of characterizing the different ways in which teachers take up their students’ ideas in the moment. This article presents and exemplifies a new methodological construct, the redirection, which provides researchers with a means of detecting nuanced differences in how teachers respond to their students’ thinking. The redirection construct emerged via systematic discourse analysis of 1 science teacher’s classroom discussions during 3 implementations of an inquiry-based module on the water cycle. Redirections are defined as instances when a teacher invites students to shift or redirect their attention to a new locus. Such shifts reflect different types of teacher responsiveness and, as such, can be used to capture the different ways in which teachers take up their students’ ideas. This article presents a comprehensive coding scheme for the redirection, in addition to segments of classroom discourse to exemplify each redirection coding category.

Studying the practices of highly regarded teachers is valuable for identifying promising practices and stubborn obstacles to reform. We found that although these highly regarded teachers allocated 3 times more class time to working with text than to teacher lecture and explanation, opportunities to engage in text-based argumentation with multiple sources were rare. Furthermore, less than a 3rd of the time allocated to working with text engaged students in actively making meaning from text. When literacy tasks did occur, they were associated with a disciplinary knowledge focus, challenging the notion that literacy activity occurs at the expense of content instruction. Close reading and cross-textual analysis frequently co-occurred with each other and with argumentation, which suggests that intervention designs should foreground these building blocks of argumentation. Disciplinary differences in opportunity to learn indicate that norms of instruction may carry greater weight than disciplinary norms of reasoning and discourse, which suggests that a particular focus on transforming literacy instruction in science may be warranted.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2016.1256809,[theory] Argumentation Theory; [theory] Opportunity to Learn Framework,[method] Interaction / Video Analysis,,,[setting] secondary education,,,[construct] argumentation,"Opportunity to Learn Framework, Argumentation Theory, Disciplinary Literacy Framework,descriptive analysis, video-based classroom coding,Argumentation-Based Learning, Disciplinary Literacy,ELA, history, and science education, secondary classrooms,opportunity to learn, argumentation, close reading, reasoning, disciplinary practice",[theory] Argumentation Theory; [theory] Opportunity to Learn Framework; [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; ; ; [setting] secondary education; ; ; [construct] argumentation,,

Although established educational practices merging sciences and arts have been studied before, the focus has been mainly on science or technology-discipline-orientated aspects. More research is needed on the characteristics of learning that address nature and the biological through art-based practices.MethodsUtilizing a case study approach, a week-long multidisciplinary project developed around bioart-making, and implemented in a Finnish upper secondary school, was scrutinized. The main data consisted of transcribed participant interviews and textual and visual material from a project blog. The data were analyzed using qualitative theory-driven content analysis to describe and understand the cross-boundary processes and human-nature interactions taking place within the project.FindingsBioart-making constituted as a boundary object bringing together different understandings of nature. Identification, coordination, reflection, and transformation processes on different levels emerged as a part of and as an outcome of bioart-making. In and through these, learners interacted with nature through intertwined events of material-experiential utilization, cognitive knowledge-building, emotional connecting, and philosophical reflection.ContributionThis paper advances the theoretical discussion on integrative art-based practices’ potential, especially in relation to learning that addresses nature and the biological",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2023.2263845,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,

The everyday cyborg engages in speculative fabulation that is about fantastical new world-making in times of multiple crises. The work presented in this article builds on previous projects that have examined how everyday cultural practices mediate consequential learning that is transformative for communities of color. Methods: Two social design-based studies draw from ethnographic analysis of two teacher education courses as well as two after-school programs focusing on digital fabrication and making and tinkering. Participants included 22 undergraduate pre-service teachers and 10 middle school students from schools in Latinx communities. Findings: Collaborative cyborg activity, where expertise is distributed, emerged as pre-service teachers and youth collectively engaged with everyday socio-political issues. This article highlights cyborg sociopolitical technical reconfigurations, where learners assembled ideational and material tools to craft objects of learning activity that went beyond those established by schooling and imagined new possible futures. Contribution: Designing learning ecologies for the everyday cyborg, in this case pre-service teachers and non-dominant youth, fosters an engagement with everyday dilemmas in ways that serve as catalysts for further learning and the new world-making of speculative fabulation.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2022.2154159,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,

Students’ Conceptions of Nation Embedded in a Historical Narrative,Lopez et al.,2014,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article focuses on university students’ understanding of the concept of nation. First an analysis of this concept from a historiographical point of view is presented. This allows for distinguishing between different conceptions of the nation related to 3 main approaches: the romantic, the modernist, and the ethnosymbolic approaches. Based on this analysis and also taking into account present research about history education and the construction of national identities, 5 different dimensions of the concept are presented: (a) historical subject, (b) identification, (c) territory, (d) legitimate claim, and (e) general concept scheme. Qualitative individual interviews were carried out with 31 Spanish college students about a Spanish foundational historical narrative, embedding the concept of nation, called the Reconquest (711 ad–1495 ad). Results indicated that although students showed tensions in their narratives, romantic conceptions dominated most of them. Possible reasons for the existence of these views are analyzed in terms of how the concept of nation is presented in and out of school. Also, implications for teaching and learning this concept are discussed, looking at learning strategies that could improve the understanding of this concept through its 5 analyzed dimensions.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2014.919863,[theory] Conceptual Change Theory; [theory] Epistemic Cognition; [theory] Identity Theory,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] interview methods,,,[setting] higher education,,,[construct] epistemic cognition; [construct] moral reasoning; [construct] narrative,"Epistemology of History, Conceptual Change Theory, Identity Theory,qualitative interviews, discourse analysis,Historical Thinking Pedagogy,history education, higher education,national identity, historical conceptions, narrative, epistemic cognition, moral reasoning",[theory] Conceptual Change Theory; [theory] Epistemic Cognition; [theory] Identity Theory; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] interview methods; ; ; [setting] higher education; ; ; [construct] epistemic cognition; [construct] moral reasoning; [construct] narrative,,

The 316 posts she wrote over 1 school year were systematically analyzed and triangulated with data from e-mail exchanges and interviews with Ms. Frizzle and her colleagues. Ms. Frizzle used her blog to tell stories of herself and her classroom, reflect on her practice, work through dilemmas, solicit feedback, and display competence, among other things. By doing so, she was able to wrestle with many issues that are central to the practice of urban science teaching and be recognized by herself and others as a “reform-minded” teacher committed to excellence and equity in education. To realize these benefits, however, Ms. Frizzle invested significant time and energy into her blogging and made certain uses of blogging features. Thus, although this study empirically supports the potential of blogging for teachers' professional identity development, it also indicates that the way in which teachers use blogging will determine the extent of the benefits they can derive from this practice.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400802192706,[theory] Communities of Practice; [theory] Identity Theory,[method] content analysis; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA),[pedagogy] Communities of Practice; [pedagogy] Reflective Practice,,[setting] digital learning environments,,,[construct] agency; [construct] belonging; [construct] community; [construct] identity; [construct] reflection,"Identity Theory, Communities of Practice,case study research, content analysis, discourse analysis,Reflective Practice, Online Professional Development,digital learning environments, pre-service and early-career teachers, blogs,reflection, identity, agency, community, belonging",[theory] Communities of Practice; [theory] Identity Theory; [method] content analysis; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [pedagogy] Communities of Practice; [pedagogy] Reflective Practice; ; [setting] digital learning environments; ; ; [construct] agency; [construct] belonging; [construct] community; [construct] identity; [construct] reflection,,

Building on research in K-12/undergraduate contexts, we investigated cognitive, interpersonal, and intrapersonal learning tactics in a sample of working adults.MethodWe conducted 75 interviews with adults in an online Master’s in Computer Science (CS) program. We used thematic analysis to organize participants’ learning tactics into five key strategies and interpreted strategy/tactic use in the context of a well-known 21st century learning framework.FindingsInterpersonal tactics were perceived as critical across domains, while the relative salience of intrapersonal and cognitive tactics differed depending on the nature of the task.

Rather than bridging home or community funds of knowledge with school learning, I propose designing disruptions to typical school practices to invite students to recruit out-of-school resources meaningful and sensible to them in order to grapple with school-valued concepts. I examine this design strategy first conceptually, then through a case called walking scale geometry, designed to disrupt the scale of typical classroom geometry. This major disruption has 4 interrelated consequences in that students must invent new tools and strategies for constructing geometry figures, spaces of activity and learning shift, students are positioned with new visual perspectives, and the division of labor is redistributed. I analyze how these 4 consequences played out in an episode of walking scale geometry, in relation to the deployment of student-recruited resources and conceptual agency, then comment on some implications for designing disruptions and hybrid learning settings.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2016.1180297,[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Embodied Knowing / Embodiment,[method] Design-Based Research (DBR),[pedagogy] Culturally Relevant / Responsive / Sustaining Pedagogy (CRP); [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Equity-Oriented Design Research,,,[subject] mathematics,,[construct] equity; [construct] participation,"Hybridity Theory, Culturally Relevant Pedagogy, Equity-Oriented Design Research,design-based research, ethnographic case study,Hybrid Learning, Disruption-Based Design,mathematics education, outdoor geometry learning,hybridity, equity, embodiment, participation, disruption",[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Embodied Knowing / Embodiment; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Culturally Relevant / Responsive / Sustaining Pedagogy (CRP); [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Equity-Oriented Design Research; ; ; [subject] mathematics; ; [construct] equity; [construct] participation,,

This study examined children’s construction of causal reasoning during collaborative discussions in elementary school classrooms and investigated whether they were able to transfer causal reasoning displayed during the discussions to individual tasks. Methods: Multilink causal chain models were tracked in 24 collaborative discussions involving 160 underserved fifth-graders, 154 individually written essays about the question addressed in the discussion, and 95 individual oral interviews about an analogous question. Path analyses were conducted to document connections between learning processes and products. Findings: Recurrent patterns of multilink causal reasoning were identified in 92% of the collaborative discussions. Students were found to use what they had learned about the construction of multilink causal chains in collaborative groups in an independently written essay and a knowledge transfer interview. Peer modeling played a key role in fostering the transfer of multilink causal reasoning for children who could not produce causal chains themselves. Contribution: Overall, this analysis of the social construction of multilink causal chains provides distinctive new evidence that enabling meaningful interaction among children promotes higher-level cognitive development.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2025.2544619,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,

339,Dynamic Science Assessment: A New Approach for Investigating Conceptual Change,Magnusson et al.,1997,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Starting from the premise that understanding conceptual change requires studying it while it occurs, this article describes a new research methodology in which students' knowledge is assessed in the context of mediated learning situations that attempt to foster conceptual change. The methodology builds on two ideas: that conceptual change in science is a matter of appropriation by individuals of culturally based knowledge (of the scientific community), and that understanding such change requires a mediated context in which the students' activity (actions and thinking) is shaped by a more experienced other who reflects the cultural norms or ideals of the scientific community that facilitate knowledge production. Specific assessments developed with these ideas in mind, which we call dynamic science assessments (DSAs), function to determine students' potential to change their understanding and as a result inform us about the process of conceptual change toward scientific knowledge. Results of a DSA about electricity that we conducted with upper elementary school children (n = 28) indicated that it was possible to foster conceptual change and to discriminate children with respect to their potential to develop scientifically accurate conceptions of current and resistance. These findings indicate the promise of using mediated learning situations, such as a DSA to study conceptual change in science, and we discuss the direction of future work given the conservative mediation in the assessments conducted in this particular instance.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0601_5,,[method] Mixed Methods; [method] Qualitative Inquiry,[pedagogy] formative assessment; [pedagogy] Scaffolding,[population] middle school,,[subject] science,,[construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] scaffolding,",conceptual change,dynamic assessment,cognitive diagnosis,,,mixed methods,pre/post assessment,qualitative analysis,,,,middle school,science education,assessment design,,,scaffolding,diagnostic feedback,inquiry learning,formative assessment,",; [method] Mixed Methods; [method] Qualitative Inquiry; [pedagogy] formative assessment; [pedagogy] Scaffolding; [population] middle school; ; [subject] science; ; [construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] scaffolding,,
340,Finding the Best Types of Guidance for Constructing Self-Explanations of Subgoals in Programming,Margulieux & Catrambone,2018,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Subgoal learning, a technique used to break down problem solving into manageable pieces, has been used to promote retention and transfer in procedural domains, such as programming. The primary method of learning subgoals has been passive, and passive learning methods are typically less effective than constructive methods. To promote constructive methods of learning subgoals, we prompted learners to self-explain the subgoals of a problem-solving procedure. Self-explanation asks learners to make sense of new information based on prior knowledge and logical reasoning. Novices’ self-explanation is typically more effective when they receive guidance, because it helps them to focus on relevant information. In the present experimental study, the types of guidance that students received while self-explaining determined whether the constructive learning method was more effective than the passive method. Participants assigned to the constructive learning method performed best when they either received hints about the subgoals or received correct explanations as feedback, but not when they received both. These findings suggest that constructive learning of subgoals can further improve the benefits of subgoal learning when students receive only guidance that complements their construction of knowledge. This nuance is important for educators who engage their students in constructive learning and self-explanation.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2018.1491852,[theory] Cognitive Load Theory; [theory] Self-Explanation Theory,[method] experimental design,[pedagogy] Cognitive Load Theory; [pedagogy] Self-Explanation,,,,,[construct] learning outcomes; [construct] metacognition,"Cognitive Load Theory, Subgoal Learning Framework, Self-Explanation Theory,experimental study, quantitative analysis,Self-Explanation Instruction, Guided Discovery Learning,computer science education, undergraduate programming instruction,self-explanation, subgoals, guidance, learning outcomes, metacognition",[theory] Cognitive Load Theory; [theory] Self-Explanation Theory; [method] experimental design; [pedagogy] Cognitive Load Theory; [pedagogy] Self-Explanation; ; ; ; ; [construct] learning outcomes; [construct] metacognition,,
341,The VCR Tutor: Effective Instruction for Device Operation,Mark & Greer,1995,Journal of the Learning Sciences,A critical issue for intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) is whether knowledgeable diagnosis and feedback offers instructional benefits compared with less knowledge-intensive instructional methods. The effectiveness of different instructional methods is examined in a device operation task: setting a VCR to record a program. Four tutoring simulations use different instructional approaches emphasizing specific types of knowledge. The possibility of acquiring this knowledge is manipulated by increasing opportunities to interact with the simulation and by explicitly providing knowledgeable diagnosis and feedback. Eighty novice adults were randomly assigned to the four tutors for training. Planned comparisons of learner achievement indicate greater learning with knowledgeable diagnosis and feedback compared to correctness feedback. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) to detect predicted linear trends shows increased instructional effectiveness across versions. Results are not simply a function of differences in training time. They support the contention that knowledgeable diagnosis and feedback can offer benefits over other instructional methods.,http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0402_3,[theory] Feedback Theory,[method] experimental design,[pedagogy] Intelligent Tutoring Systems,[population] adult learners,,,[technology] intelligent tutoring systems,,",cognitive tutoring,intelligent tutoring systems,feedback theory,,,controlled experiment,system design,user testing,,,,adult learners,procedural learning,technology-based instruction,,,diagnostic feedback,procedural knowledge,intelligent instruction,system effectiveness ,",[theory] Feedback Theory; [method] experimental design; [pedagogy] Intelligent Tutoring Systems; [population] adult learners; ; ; [technology] intelligent tutoring systems; ,,

Most PD studies focus on its content or structure to gauge learning, leaving substantive gaps in our understanding of teacher learning processes and the role of contexts. Therefore, we investigate teachers’ learning as they take practices from PD and adapt them to their own settings.MethodsUsing ethnographic methods and taking a situative perspective, we offer an in-depth comparative case study of two teachers’ PD learning over time and across contexts.FindingsWe find that teachers’ learning was shaped in the process of recontextualizing practices from PD into their classrooms through agentic synthesis of these practices with contextual particulars: namely, salient problems of practice, learning in other contexts, idealized teacher identities, contextually situated goals, challenges of implementation, and other related affordances and constraints. Through this synthesis, they developed what we call personally meaningful practices, which may or may not reflect the intent of the original PD practice.ContributionOur work contributes to theory of how teachers’ learning occurs by illuminating agentic synthesis as a core process resulting from teachers recontextualizing practices from PD.

Research into this problem has identified several areas where students commonly struggle with fractions. While there are many theories of fraction learning, none of the research on these theories employs samples large enough to test theories at scale or nuanced enough to demonstrate how learning unfolds over time during instructional activities based on these theories. The work reported here uses learning analytics methods with fine-grained log data from an online fraction game to unpack how splitting (i.e. partitioning a whole into equal-sized parts) impacts learning. Study 1 demonstrated that playing the game significantly improved students’ fraction understanding. In addition, a cluster analysis suggested that exploring splitting was beneficial. Study 2 replicated the learning results, and a cluster analysis showed that compared to early game play, later game play showed more optimal splitting strategies. In addition, in looking at the types of transitions that were possible between a student’s early cluster categorization and later cluster categorization, we found that some types of transitions were more beneficial for learning than others.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2015.1078244,[theory] Cognitive Development; [theory] Learning Analytics; [theory] Learning Trajectories Framework,[method] learning analytics,,,[setting] online learning,[subject] mathematics,[technology] games; [technology] learning analytics,[construct] conceptual understanding,"Learning Analytics Framework, Constructivist Learning Theory, Cognitive Development Framework,learning analytics, cluster analysis, experimental replication,Game-Based Learning, Technology-Enhanced Mathematics Education,mathematics education, online learning environments,splitting, fractions, learning trajectories, analytics, conceptual change",[theory] Cognitive Development; [theory] Learning Analytics; [theory] Learning Trajectories Framework; [method] learning analytics; ; ; [setting] online learning; [subject] mathematics; [technology] games; [technology] learning analytics; [construct] conceptual understanding,,

346,On Some Necessary Conditions of Learning,Marton & Pang,2006,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The purpose of this article is to identify some necessary conditions of learning. To learn something, the learner must discern what is to be learned (the object of learning). Discerning the object of learning amounts to discerning its critical aspects. To discern an aspect, the learner must experience potential alternatives, that is, variation in a dimension corresponding to that aspect, against the background of invariance in other aspects of the same object of learning. (One could not discern the color of things, for instance, if there was only one color.) The study results illustrate that what students learn in a sequence of lessons is indeed a function of the pattern of variation and invariance constituted in that sequence.

347,Sameness and Difference in Transfer,Marton,2006,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Discussions about transfer have mainly dealt with how people manage to do something in a situation thanks to having done something similar in a previous situation. From an educational point of view, however, it appears more fruitful to consider the case when the learner, having learned to do something in 1 situation, might be able to do something different in other situations, thanks to perceived differences (and similarities) between situations. The case is made for widening the focus of attention to how situations are related through differences (and similarities).",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls1504_3,[theory] Variation Theory of Learning,[method] comparative analysis,,,,,,[construct] variation,"Variation Theory of Learning, Phenomenography,comparative analysis, qualitative synthesis,Variation Theory Pedagogy,general education, classroom contexts,variation, contrast, discernment, awareness, differentiation",[theory] Variation Theory of Learning; [method] comparative analysis; ; ; ; ; ; [construct] variation,,
348,The effect of language on the coherence of children’s conceptions of force,Masri & Amin,2023,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: The coherence of learners’ pre-instruction conceptions has been debated for some time. Studies on conceptions of force, specifically, have produced very different results in different contexts around the world. In this study, an integrative theoretical framework linking semantic differences across languages to concept learning in childhood is proposed, motivating the hypothesis that language is a population variable that impacts the coherence of young learners’ conceptions of force. Method: This study uses the same structured interview developed in a previous study by Ioannides and Vosniadoue but in a new context—the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia—with three groups of elementary school children (7–12 years of age; n = 185): monolingual in Arabic; monolingual in English; and bilingual in Arabic and English. Findings: The results support the hypothesis that language impacts the coherence of children’s conceptions of force with Arabic monolinguals exhibiting greater coherence than English monolinguals, and bilingual children exhibiting intermediate coherence. Contribution: This paper provides evidence for the effect of semantic differences across languages and the phenomenon of lexical polysemy on the coherence of children’s initial conceptions of force. The relationship between the integrative theoretical framework proposed and other theories of conceptual change and its novel pedagogical implications are discussed.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2023.2210138,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,
349,Historical Inquiry in an Informal Fan Community: Online Source Usage and the TV Show<i>The Tudors</i>,Matthews,2015,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article examines an informal online community dedicated to The Tudors, a historical television show, and the ways in which its members engaged with a variety of sources in their discussions of the drama’s real-life past. Data were collected over a 5-month period. The analysis included the types of sources used in conversation; members’ purpose for invoking and reaction to sources; as well as topic, participation, and response patterns in the discussion forum. The community is a space in which popular culture and the discipline of history meet. Members come together because of a fictional depiction of the past, yet a desire to corroborate, clarify, contextualize, or uncover what really happened leads users to participate in detective-like inquiry work and the learning of new topics they had not previously considered. Members also challenge and critique one another’s positions and the sources other members invoke in multiple ways, including by using more formal disciplinary heuristics in this informal setting. Key differences emerge in members’ purpose for invoking sources, with popular media used more frequently for illustrating a point or asking a question and nonfiction works most invoked to support and argue historical claims.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2015.1112285,,[method] content analysis; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Ethnography,,,[setting] informal learning,[subject] media literacy,,[construct] participation,"Historical Inquiry Framework, Media Literacy, Sociocultural Learning Theory,discourse analysis, content analysis, ethnography,Informal Online Learning, Media-Based Historical Inquiry,informal learning, online fan community,historical reasoning, sourcing, critique, participation, disciplinary literacy",; [method] content analysis; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Ethnography; ; ; [setting] informal learning; [subject] media literacy; ; [construct] participation,,

In particular, I focus on the communication between the students and myself as the teacher in the classroom. This unique perspective allows me to offer insights into the teacher's decision-making process and how those decisions influenced the opportunities for learning.

352,Science on the Web: Students Online in a Sixth-Grade Classroom,McCrory Wallace et al.,2000,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Publications from newspapers to research journals are filled with claims about the Internet and its value for education, yet research is just beginning to evaluate uses of these new information resources in the classroom. As part of the University of Michigan Digital Library Project, this research was undertaken as a first step in designing tools for secondary students to access a digital library. The Web offered an initial site for learning how students interact with digital resources and use standard tools. The Web can be seen as a site for student inquiry in science, using it as an information resource that opens the boundaries of the classroom and creates the possibility for students to pursue questions of personal interest. This study looks at students in 6th-grade science classes as they use the Web to carry out an inquiry-based assignment. Their understanding and enactment of their assignment to do research on the Web, their engagement in information seeking, and their use of Web technologies are explored and analyzed. Findings: include evidence that students use Web technologies easily but simplistically; that information seeking is a complex and difficult process for these students, who seek to reduce the task to finding an obvious answer or finding a good Web site; and that developing students' understanding of content through use of the Web is a challenge for students and teachers.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0901_5,[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Social Constructivism,[method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Ethnography,[pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL),[population] middle school,[setting] online learning,[subject] science,[technology] online forums; [technology] web-based learning environments,[construct] collaboration,",social constructivism,inquiry-based learning,technology-enhanced learning,,,design-based research,classroom ethnography,,,,middle school,science education,online learning,,,web-based learning environments,information search,student inquiry,collaboration,internet tools,",[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Social Constructivism; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Ethnography; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL); [population] middle school; [setting] online learning; [subject] science; [technology] online forums; [technology] web-based learning environments; [construct] collaboration,,

This article investigated the influence of scaffolding on 331 seventh-grade students' writing of scientific explanations during an 8-week, project-based chemistry unit in which the construction of scientific explanations is a key learning goal. The unit makes an instructional model for explanation explicit to students through a focal lesson and reinforces that model through subsequent written support for each investigation. Students received 1 of 2 treatments in terms of the type of written support: continuous, involving detailed support for every investigation, or faded, involving less support over time. The analyses showed significant learning gains for students for all components of scientific explanation (i.e., claim, evidence, and reasoning). However, on posttest items lacking scaffolds, the faded group gave stronger explanations in terms of their reasoning compared to the continuous group. Fading written scaffolds better equipped students to write explanations when they were not provided with support.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls1502_1,[theory] Cognitive Apprenticeship; [theory] Scaffolding Theory,[method] content analysis; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] quasi-experimental design,[pedagogy] Cognitive Apprenticeship; [pedagogy] Scaffolding,,,[subject] science,,[construct] agency; [construct] epistemic agency; [construct] Epistemic Agency; [construct] explanation; [construct] reflection; [construct] scaffolding,"Scaffolding Theory, Inquiry-Based Science Education (IBSE), Cognitive Apprenticeship,quasi-experimental design, discourse analysis, content analysis,Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL), Scaffolded Instruction,science education, middle school classrooms,explanation, reasoning, scaffolding, reflection, epistemic agency",[theory] Cognitive Apprenticeship; [theory] Scaffolding Theory; [method] content analysis; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] quasi-experimental design; [pedagogy] Cognitive Apprenticeship; [pedagogy] Scaffolding; ; ; [subject] science; ; [construct] agency; [construct] epistemic agency; [construct] Epistemic Agency; [construct] explanation; [construct] reflection; [construct] scaffolding,,
356,Synergy Between Teacher Practices and Curricular Scaffolds to Support Students in Using Domain-Specific and Domain-General Knowledge in Writing Arguments to Explain Phenomena,McNeill & Krajcik,2009,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"We investigated how 2 different curricular scaffolds (context-specific vs. generic), teacher instructional practices, and the interaction between these 2 types of support influenced students' learning of science content and their ability to write scientific arguments to explain phenomena. The context-specific scaffolds provided students with hints about the task and what content knowledge to use in or incorporate into their writing. The generic scaffolds supported students in understanding a general framework (i.e., claim, evidence, and reasoning) regardless of the content area or task. This study focused on an 8-week middle school chemistry curriculum that was enacted by 6 teachers with 578 students during the 2004–2005 school year. Analyses of identical pre- and posttests as well as videotapes of teacher enactments revealed that the curricular scaffolds and teacher instructional practices were synergistic in that the effect of the written curricular scaffolds depended on the teacher's enactment of the curriculum. The context-specific curricular scaffolds were more successful in supporting students in writing scientific arguments to explain phenomena, but only when teachers' enactments provided explicit domain-general support for the claim, evidence, and reasoning framework, suggesting the importance of both types of support in successful learning environments.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400903013488,[theory] Argumentation Theory; [theory] Scaffolding Theory,[method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [method] quasi-experimental design,[pedagogy] Scaffolding,[population] in-service teachers; [population] teachers,,[subject] chemistry,,[construct] argumentation; [construct] evidence; [construct] scaffolding,"Argumentation Theory, Inquiry-Based Science Education (IBSE), Scaffolding Theory,quasi-experimental design, video analysis, pre/post testing,Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL), Scaffolded Instruction,chemistry education, middle school classrooms, in-service teachers,argumentation, reasoning, evidence, scaffolding, synergy",[theory] Argumentation Theory; [theory] Scaffolding Theory; [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [method] quasi-experimental design; [pedagogy] Scaffolding; [population] in-service teachers; [population] teachers; ; [subject] chemistry; ; [construct] argumentation; [construct] evidence; [construct] scaffolding,,

To support these changes, most teachers need to alter the way they teach and require professional learning.MethodsWe used a case study approach to investigate 30 science teachers’ instructional vision of science during a four-day curriculum-based professional learning workshop. We collected multiple data sources including pre and post surveys, post interviews, and video recordings of all sessions.FindingsOur analysis found that teachers’ instructional vision shifted away from traditional instruction and toward a vision that empowered student voice and increased equitable opportunities for science. Furthermore, teachers raised concerns about this vision because of the newness of the approach and unease about their specific students and context.ContributionCritical design features of the curriculum-based professional learning workshop included the following: Offering the student perspective, providing images of classroom instruction, and supporting collaborative teacher reflection. Furthermore, pedagogical sensemaking as a mediating process highlighted the importance of dissonance in teachers recognizing key differences in their current practice compared to this new approach.

We illustrate how calculus faculty varyingly engaged these colorblind discourses as well as discourses that challenged such conceptions of instruction. We also highlight how faculty dysconsciousness in reports of instructional practices reflect potential operationalization of dominant discourses that reinforce colorblind racism.ContributionWith limited research on faculty perspectives on racial equity in mathematics, our study documents how color-evasive, gender-neutral discourses among mathematics faculty shape orientations to instruction that reinforce the gatekeeping role of calculus in STEM higher education.

I analyzed children's epistemic reasoning, following a design experiment scaffolding increasing regulation of scientific inquiry in a domain they studied in depth. Participants consisted of children in two first grade classes (n = 35). The study capitalizes on the final phase of the design experiment, wherein pairs assumed substantial responsibility for design and implementation of an investigation pursuing their own question. I conducted structured interviews with each pair, eliciting their thinking about their investigation. Forty-three percent of the children attributed uncertainty to their findings. Forty-nine percent transcended phenomenon-based reasoning in thinking about how to improve their study, reasoning instead in terms of relation between variables. Forty percent posited additional potentially influential variables, reflecting a tacit understanding of the lack of any straightforward one-to-one correspondence between cause and effect. These findings suggest that epistemic reasoning is plastic, sensitive to instructional opportunities. I argue that the children's relatively deep familiarity with the domain, experience in assuming increasing responsibility for structuring scientific inquiry, and investment they had in their own investigations contributed to the surprisingly robust epistemic reasoning they revealed in this context.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2011.529325,[theory] Developmental Psychology; [theory] Epistemic Cognition,[method] longitudinal study; [method] Mixed Methods,[pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Science Education (IBSE),,[setting] elementary classrooms,,,[construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] development; [construct] epistemic cognition; [construct] scientific reasoning,"Developmental Psychology, Epistemic Cognition, Inquiry-Based Science Education,longitudinal study, mixed methods, interview analysis,Inquiry-Based Science Learning,early childhood science education, elementary classrooms, young children,epistemic understanding, development, scientific reasoning, instruction, conceptual growth",[theory] Developmental Psychology; [theory] Epistemic Cognition; [method] longitudinal study; [method] Mixed Methods; [pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Science Education (IBSE); ; [setting] elementary classrooms; ; ; [construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] development; [construct] epistemic cognition; [construct] scientific reasoning,,

The intervention was implemented in both researcher-taught summer school and regular school-year classrooms in two consecutive years, allowing refinement of instruction mid-course, as well as comparison of learning outcomes. A case study examined how the pedagogy functioned within a strategically selected segment of curriculum enactment. Analysis of pre- and post-instruction interviews, using mean scaled estimates and maximum learning progression levels, revealed significant conceptual advancements for all cohorts across both sites and years. After Year I, a majority of children in researcher-taught and regular classrooms could predict and explain the impact of traits’ differential survival advantage on next-generation shifts in relative frequency given particular environmental change. After Year II, the majority in each cohort formed normative predictions and explanations of population changes across multiple generations.

The hallmarks of advanced literacy are specific to different fields of study. This article proposes a descriptive framework for adolescents' historical writing. Qualitative analyses of 56 written responses to a document-based essay question by high school juniors are used to identify and illustrate trends in adolescents' use of evidence in their historical writing. These trends—referred to as characteristics of students' historical writing—include factual and interpretive accuracy, persuasiveness of evidence, sources of evidence, corroboration of evidence, and contextualization of evidence. This article identifies benchmarks and shares a range of student work samples for each characteristic. Defining the nature of historical writing provides a framework for integrating literacy and content and for exploring and developing advanced literacy skills through the particularities of subject-specific composition.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2010.481014,[theory] Argumentation Theory; [theory] Epistemic Cognition,[method] Case Study Research; [method] coding and categorization; [method] qualitative coding,,,[setting] secondary education,,,[construct] argumentation; [construct] epistemic cognition; [construct] epistemic stance; [construct] evidence,"Disciplinary Literacy Framework, Historical Thinking Theory, Epistemic Cognition,text analysis, case study, qualitative coding,Writing-to-Learn, Historical Inquiry,history education, secondary classrooms, adolescents,disciplinary literacy, argumentation, sourcing, evidence use, epistemic stance",[theory] Argumentation Theory; [theory] Epistemic Cognition; [method] Case Study Research; [method] coding and categorization; [method] qualitative coding; ; ; [setting] secondary education; ; ; [construct] argumentation; [construct] epistemic cognition; [construct] epistemic stance; [construct] evidence,,

We identify and track 4 components of PCK that are relevant to teaching history: representing history, transforming history, attending to students' ideas about history, and framing history. We find that these 2 novices demonstrated different aspects of PCK in different settings at different points in the first 3 years of their careers. Their PCK continued to grow after preservice education, although the pace and substance of this development varied. In particular, attending to students' ideas about history and framing history were more challenging aspects of PCK for these novices. Specific features of the teacher education program, the school context, and the individual teacher's capacity facilitate growth in PCK, including opportunities to practice, alignment within the teacher education program and across learning sites, reflection on practice, and subject matter knowledge.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2012.742016,,[method] longitudinal study; [method] participant observation,[pedagogy] Reflective Practice,[population] novices,[setting] classrooms; [setting] secondary education,,,[construct] reflection; [construct] representations,"Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) Framework, Teacher Learning Theory, Historical Thinking Framework,longitudinal case study, classroom observation, artifact analysis,History Teaching, Reflective Practice,history education, secondary classrooms, novice teachers,PCK, teacher learning, representation, transformation, student ideas",; [method] longitudinal study; [method] participant observation; [pedagogy] Reflective Practice; [population] novices; [setting] classrooms; [setting] secondary education; ; ; [construct] reflection; [construct] representations,,
368,Discourse Generation for Instructional Applications: Identifying and Exploiting Relevant Prior Explanations,Moore et al.,1996,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"To reap the benefits of natural language interaction, tutorial systems must be endowed with the properties that make human natural-language interaction so effective. One striking feature of naturally occurring interactions is that human tutors and students freely refer to the context created by prior explanations. In contrast, computer-generated utterances that do not draw on the previous discourse often seem awkward and unnatural and may even be incoherent. The explanations produced by such systems are frustrating to students because they repeat the same information over and over again. Perhaps more critical is that, by not referring to prior explanations, computer-based tutors are not pointing out similarities between problem-solving situations and therefore may be missing out on opportunities to help students form generalizations. In this article, we discuss several observations from an analysis of human-human tutorial interactions and provide examples of the ways in which tutors and students refer to previous explanations. We describe how we have used a case-based reasoning algorithm to enable a computational system to identify prior explanations that may be relevant to the explanation currently being generated. We then describe two computational systems that can exploit this knowledge about relevant prior explanations in constructing their subsequent explanations.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0501_3,,[method] computational modeling; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA),[pedagogy] Case-Based Learning (CBL); [pedagogy] Case-Based Reasoning; [pedagogy] Intelligent Tutoring Systems; [theory] Case-Based Instruction; [theory] Case-Based Reasoning,,,,[technology] computational modeling; [technology] computer-based instruction; [technology] human–computer interaction; [technology] intelligent tutoring systems; [technology] natural language processing (NLP),,",case-based reasoning,natural language generation,intelligent tutoring,,,computational modeling,human–computer interaction,discourse analysis,,,,intelligent tutoring systems,computer-based learning environments,,,explanation generation,dialogue context,coherence,instructional discourse,",; [method] computational modeling; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [pedagogy] Case-Based Learning (CBL); [pedagogy] Case-Based Reasoning; [pedagogy] Intelligent Tutoring Systems; [theory] Case-Based Instruction; [theory] Case-Based Reasoning; ; ; ; [technology] computational modeling; [technology] computer-based instruction; [technology] human–computer interaction; [technology] intelligent tutoring systems; [technology] natural language processing (NLP); ,,
369,Moving Up and Getting Steeper: Negotiating Shared Descriptions of Linear Graphs,Moschkovich,1996,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This study examines mathematics learning in the context of peer discussions by focusing on students' descriptions of lines graphed on a computer screen. The article describes how these discussions provided a rich context for negotiating shared descriptions, supported conceptual change, and resulted in convergent meanings through reciprocal elaborations and clarifications. The participants in the study used graphing software to explore the connections between linear equations and their graphs with a peer. The article presents the analysis of three case studies examining how students negotiated shared descriptions of lines. These conversations supported students' construction of shared descriptions, but not necessarily by presenting conflicting ideas or through one student guiding another. Rather, negotiation functioned through local conversational resources such as the use of reference objects, spatial metaphors, and coordinated gestures and talk. These case studies also point to an important role for instruction in orchestrating and supporting peer discussions by modeling how to resolve negotiations and maintaining students' focus on mathematically productive learning trajectories.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0503_4,,[method] Case Study Research; [method] participant observation,,,[setting] higher education,[subject] mathematics,,[construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] negotiation,",Sociocultural Perspective,conceptual change,, Case Studies,Classroom Observations,,, Mathematics Education,Algebra Course,Higher Education,Graphical Representations of Functions,, graphing software,peer discussions,negotiation,",; [method] Case Study Research; [method] participant observation; ; ; [setting] higher education; [subject] mathematics; ; [construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] negotiation,,

The examples presented show how students refined their use of the x-intercept by (a) narrowing the problem contexts in which they applied this conception, (b) making connections between conceptions, (c) using a mathematical procedure, and (d) refining their verbal descriptions of how the graph of a line changes as a result of a change in the equation. The analysis draws on diSessa's (1993) theory of science learning and the recommendations made by Smith, diSessa, and Roschelle (1993) for describing conceptual change.

371,"“I Went by Twos, He Went by One”: Multiple Interpretations of Inscriptions as Resources for Mathematical Discussions",Moschkovich,2008,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article examines a classroom discussion of multiple interpretations of the scales on two distance versus time graphs. The analysis describes how two students and a teacher used multiple meanings for phrases of the form “I went by” and coordinated these meanings with different views of the scales. Students' ambiguous and shifting meanings did not prove to be obstacles to this discussion. Instead, this teacher used student interpretations as resources, built on them, and connected them to canonical mathematical concepts—in particular by highlighting (CitationGoodwin, 1994) a “unitized” (CitationLamon, 1994, Citation1996, Citation2007) view of the scales. Research in mathematics education describes teaching that promotes conceptual development as having two central features: One is that teachers and students attend explicitly to concepts, and the other is that students wrestle with important mathematics (CitationHiebert & Grouws, 2007). Not only does this classroom discussion provide an example that it is possible to balance these two features, but the analysis provides the details of how instruction can simultaneously provide explicit attention to concepts while allowing students to wrestle with these concepts.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400802395077,[theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Microgenetic Method,,,,[subject] mathematics,,[construct] ambiguity; [construct] dialogue; [construct] representations,"Sociocultural Theory, Discourse Theory, Representational Theory,classroom discourse analysis, microgenetic analysis,Inquiry-Based Mathematics Instruction,mathematics, middle school classrooms,inscriptions, representation, ambiguity, conceptual reasoning, dialogue",[theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Microgenetic Method; ; ; ; [subject] mathematics; ; [construct] ambiguity; [construct] dialogue; [construct] representations,,

However, much of the research in these areas examines how teachers reason during sustained collegial discourse outside the classroom.MethodsThis exploratory case study of one side-by-side coaching session, in which a coach and teacher collaborate to support both student and teacher learning in the classroom, qualitatively examined the coach-teacher discourse to determine whether and how pedagogical sensemaking can occur in a practice-embedded teacher learning setting.FindingsWe find that generative pedagogical sensemaking is possible despite the contextual constraints. Findings: indicate that teacher-coach interactions included and frequently moved between talk at three altitudes: within, across, and beyond moments of the lesson. The topics of these interactions were complex and connected across the lesson.ContributionThese findings point to particular affordances of practice-embedded settings for generative pedagogical sensemaking. While prior research has emphasized the need for sustained time for sensemaking to support teacher learning, this study expands this conception by finding that, when coupled with shared experiences of pedagogy, brief, cumulative interactions during teaching can also create opportunities for generativity.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2022.2132863,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,

In this study, we forward a theory that the development of pedagogical empathy, or the capacity to understand the implications of student emotions and use emotional data to make adaptive pedagogical decisions, is a component of adaptive expertise.MethodsUsing qualitative methods to analyze the discourse in eight debrief discussions among secondary mathematics teachers following rehearsals of practice, we examine how teachers used this opportunity to generate and use emotional data in support of the development of pedagogical empathy.FindingsWe found that rehearsal debriefs provided an opportunity to make emotional data available to participants in three ways and that teachers then used that emotional data in six ways across the debriefs. Student emotions, both from teachers in the position of students and in consideration of hypothetical students in the classroom, were pervasive in the debrief discussions.ContributionAfter considering the ways in which emotional data were made visible and used, we return to theory to consider how these highlight the opportunities rehearsals offer to develop pedagogical empathy and discuss implications for teacher education and future research.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2023.2269547,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,

378,Technology-Mediation and Tutoring: How Do They Shape Progressive Inquiry Discourse?,Muukkonen et al.,2005,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"In higher education, there is a challenge to gain the full benefit of the potentials of learning technology for collaborative knowledge advancement and for scaffolding practices of academic literacy and scientific argumentation. The technology, ideally, would be used to provide support that enables students to deal with more demanding tasks than they could otherwise handle. We investigated the benefits of learning technology by examining the role of technology-mediation and tutoring in directing students' knowledge production in inquiry-based learning. A comparative analysis of inquiry discourse was conducted for 3 conditions between nonmediated and technology-mediated inquiry processes, the latter both tutored and nontutored. Qualitative content analysis was employed to examine how the scale of scaffolding related to the nature of knowledge produced. Furthermore, a descriptive analysis of the progression of discourse was conducted to examine evidence for deepening the question-explanation process, development of ideas in dialogue, and self-reflection. The scaffolding provided by the learning technology (The Future Learning Environment), together with the possibility for dialogue, appear to have supported practices of problem-setting, self-reflection, and collaborative development of ideas. Students in the 2 technology-mediated conditions were developing their ideas in dialogue, building on each other's knowledge and questions. Tutoring was found to be valuable for providing additional models and tools for advancing inquiry. Specific to the students of the nontechnology condition (who wrote learning-logs) was that they put more effort into understanding the theoretical content, evaluating and arguing it, but they did not engage in shared development of ideas. Through a combination of the practices, the authors foresee a potential, in higher education, for development of in-depth inquiry and practices of knowledge advancement including the nurturance of epistemic agency.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls1404_3,[theory] Distributed Cognition; [theory] Scaffolding Theory,[method] comparative analysis; [method] content analysis; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA),[pedagogy] Scaffolding,,[setting] higher education; [setting] online learning,[subject] science,,[construct] agency; [construct] collaboration; [construct] distributed cognition; [construct] epistemic agency; [construct] Epistemic Agency; [construct] reflection; [construct] scaffolding,"Knowledge Building Theory, Distributed Cognition, Scaffolding Theory,comparative analysis, qualitative content analysis, discourse analysis,Progressive Inquiry, Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL),science education, undergraduate classrooms, online learning environments,scaffolding, collaboration, epistemic agency, reflection, inquiry",[theory] Distributed Cognition; [theory] Scaffolding Theory; [method] comparative analysis; [method] content analysis; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [pedagogy] Scaffolding; ; [setting] higher education; [setting] online learning; [subject] science; ; [construct] agency; [construct] collaboration; [construct] distributed cognition; [construct] epistemic agency; [construct] Epistemic Agency; [construct] reflection; [construct] scaffolding,,

We draw on the notion of racialized learning pathways to examine access to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning spaces and the ways in which decisions about engaging these learning settings are bound up in notions of race, racial identity, gender, and belonging. We also take up the questions of how researchers and educators can intentionally design for positive racialization toward more inclusive school organization and classrooms. This article contributes to understanding of (a) how learning and identity development are mediated by broader processes of racialization tied to schooling organization and access structures and (b) how racial and gender inequities in STEM can be both reproduced and contested in large urban schools serving racially and socioeconomically diverse students. We contribute to the literature on equity and access in STEM by attending to the racialization processes that we argue are always at work in urban schools, particularly so in schools that are organized into pathways demarcated along racialized lines.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2017.1314215,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,
384,"To Disagree, We Must Also Agree: How Intersubjectivity Structures and Perpetuates Discourse in a Mathematics Classroom",Nathan et al.,2007,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Learning in a socially mediated context like a classroom places emphasis on the ability of learners to communicate their ideas to others, and for members of a class to achieve shared meaning or intersubjectivity (IS). We take a participatory view of IS, where both consensual agreement and disagreement are regarded as aspects of a common set of processes that mediate collective activity. Interlocutors need not demonstrate convergence toward a common idea or solution to exhibit IS and, indeed, they appear to need a shared understanding to express substantive disagreement through divergent views. Multilevel, multimodal analyses of videotape of a middle school mathematics classroom, including speech, gestures, drawing, and object use, reveal a discourse that is organized into recurrent sequences of event triads. The dynamics toward and away from convergent ideas appears to be instrumental in fostering sustained and engaging discourse and influencing the representations that students propose during problem solving. Participants frequently exhibited IS, but, as allowed for in the participatory view, the interactions did not seem to convert many students from their initial interpretations. Instead, disagreements and a desire to establish common understanding appeared to lead participants to express their divergent views in more refined and accessible ways. Advancement of our understanding of the role that IS serves in socially mediated learning has the potential to inform both educational theory and emerging areas in embodied cognition and cognitive neuroscience that addresses imitation and empathy, and thus help to bridge research between brain function and social cognition.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400701525238,[theory] Intersubjectivity; [theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Interaction / Video Analysis,,,,[subject] mathematics,,[construct] discourse; [construct] participation,"Sociocultural Theory, Intersubjectivity, Discourse Theory,classroom discourse analysis, video analysis,Inquiry-Based Mathematics Instruction,mathematics, middle school classrooms, teachers and students,intersubjectivity, agreement, discourse, reasoning, participation",[theory] Intersubjectivity; [theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; ; ; ; [subject] mathematics; ; [construct] discourse; [construct] participation,,
385,Embodiment in mathematics teaching and learning: evidence from learners' and teachers' gestures,Nathan,,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Gestures are often taken as evidence that the body is involved in thinking and speaking about the ideas expressed in those gestures. In this article, we present evidence drawn from teachers’ and learners’ gestures to make the case that mathematical knowledge is embodied.We argue that mathematical cognition is embodied in 2 key senses: It is based in perception and action, and it is grounded in the physical environment. We present evidence for each of these claims drawn from the gestures that teachers and learners produce when they explain mathematical concepts and ideas. We argue that (a) pointing gestures reflect the grounding of cognition in the physical environment, (b) representational gestures manifest mental simulations of action and perception, and (c) some metaphoric gestures reflect body-based conceptual metaphors. Thus, gestures reveal that some aspects of mathematical thinking are embodied.",https://www.academia.edu/download/30874206/2012_Alibali_Nathan_JLS_Embodiment_Instruction_Gesture.pdf,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,

Three levels of goals were identified as operative in the learning situation: task-completion goals, instructional goals, and personal knowledge-building goals. Although protocol statements indicating knowledge-building goals were infrequent, students exhibiting a relatively high proportion of them were distinctive in several ways. They did significantly better on a posttest. Their performance in goal cue selections differed from that of other participants in ways consistent with their orientation: They responded more often to learning goal cues than to task goal cues. They actively related new learning to prior knowledge and they posed and tried to solve problems and questions. Students oriented toward instructional goals tended to focus on what was explicitly taught. Students oriented toward task-completion goals tended to equate learning with successful completion of assigned tasks. Level of goal orientation and posttest performance were unrelated to level of education and prior computer experience but were positively related to previous experience of independent learning",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.1991.9671972,,[method] experimental design; [method] think-aloud protocols,[pedagogy] Metacognitive Strategy Instruction,[population] adult learners,,[subject] computer science / programming,[technology] computer-based instruction,[construct] goal orientation; [construct] motivation,",goal orientation,task-completion,instructional goals,knowledge-building goals,,think-aloud,experimental design,posttests,,,adult learners,programming,computer-based instruction,,,motivation,independent learning,prior knowledge,learning strategies,",; [method] experimental design; [method] think-aloud protocols; [pedagogy] Metacognitive Strategy Instruction; [population] adult learners; ; [subject] computer science / programming; [technology] computer-based instruction; [construct] goal orientation; [construct] motivation,,

Building upon the work of Lucy Suchman, we examine how canoers plan to run rapids and how plans serve as resources for action.Methods: In ethnographically-informed manner, we followed a team of canoers across various contexts of rapid scouting and running. By mounting video cameras on canoeing dyads’ helmets, we captured the team’s discursive construction of plans, how canoe partners took up the collective production of plans to elaborate their own plans, and how plans seemed to function as resources for canoeing action.Findings: Through the analysis of three episodes of rapid running, we articulate detailed descriptions of reasoning processes at the collective, canoeing dyad and individual levels, and draw relationships between them to explain observed canoeing performance in its full complexity.Contribution: We show that drawing on intersections, affinities, and complementarities between principles and theoretical constructs from both cognitive and situative theories of learning may achieve a more holistic, multi-level, and fine-grained description of knowing and learning as ongoing, at once collective and individual achievements.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2021.1936530,[theory] Deweyan Pragmatism / Deweyan Philosophy; [theory] Distributed Cognition; [theory] Embodied Cognition; [theory] Embodied Knowing / Embodiment,[method] Ethnography; [method] multimodal analysis,[pedagogy] Embodied Learning; [pedagogy] Experiential Learning,,[setting] outdoor education,,,[construct] collaboration; [construct] community; [construct] coordination; [construct] distributed cognition,"Situated Learning Theory, Distributed Cognition, Embodied Cognition,ethnography, multimodal interaction analysis,Experiential Learning, Embodied Learning,outdoor education, field-based community learning,embodiment, planning, coordination, community, situated action",[theory] Deweyan Pragmatism / Deweyan Philosophy; [theory] Distributed Cognition; [theory] Embodied Cognition; [theory] Embodied Knowing / Embodiment; [method] Ethnography; [method] multimodal analysis; [pedagogy] Embodied Learning; [pedagogy] Experiential Learning; ; [setting] outdoor education; ; ; [construct] collaboration; [construct] community; [construct] coordination; [construct] distributed cognition,,

It addresses gaps in HPT research by (a) linking HPT to theories and research from the social science disciplines on perspective taking and the self and (b) proposing a way to analyze how different tasks may elicit different kinds of HPT. The framework is grounded in a study in which 4 young adults thought aloud while taking the perspective of a victim or a perpetrator at the Salem Witch Trials and in a Holocaust-era massacre. Four shifting self perspectives were identified, whereby participants thought as their present-day selves, constructed hypothetical and imagined past selves, and made timeless generalizations about humans. To demonstrate the utility of the framework, I then use it to consider how task characteristics may elicit differential use of the self perspectives. It is argued that close attention to these self perspectives is a novel and crucial way to bring nuance to the concept of HPT, and implications for multiple learning environments are discussed.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2016.1160830,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,

We asked: (1) What are the outcomes of IL-Humanities in terms of interdisciplinary competences? (2) How do learners in these environments engage in cross-disciplinary knowledge building and transdisciplinary identity work?MethodsWe assessed the efficacy of IL-Humanities across ten Israeli middle schools through a pre-post intervention/comparison design, utilizing the novel Interdisciplinary Competences Assessment (ICA). Qualitative insights into the learning processes within classrooms were derived using discourse analysis methods.FindingsStudents’ interdisciplinary competences were found to increase following the IL-Humanities interventions. Qualitative analyses offered “thick descriptions” of the process: Students leveraged cross-disciplinary transfer of knowledge to deepen their understanding of complex phenomena and used personal narratives to engage in identity work.ContributionThis study enhances interdisciplinary education research by: (1) providing and operationalizing a model of interdisciplinary competences as an assessment tool; (2) demonstrating the effectiveness of IL-Humanities environments in developing these competences; and (3) advancing our understanding of learners’ engagement with cross-disciplinary knowledge building and transdisciplinary identity work.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2024.2346915,[theory] Knowledge Building (KB),[method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Mixed Methods,,[population] middle school,,[subject] humanities education,,[construct] competence; [construct] identity; [construct] knowledge; [construct] narrative,",knowledge building,identity work,interdisciplinary competences model,,,mixed methods,pre-post intervention,discourse analysis,,,,middle school,humanities education,interdisciplinary curriculum,,,identity,cross-disciplinary transfer,competence development,narrative,personal meaning,",[theory] Knowledge Building (KB); [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Mixed Methods; ; [population] middle school; ; [subject] humanities education; ; [construct] competence; [construct] identity; [construct] knowledge; [construct] narrative,,

Building on the theory of expansive learning, we ask what kinds of learning cycles may be identified in home care encounters charged with implementing the new Mobility Agreement practice, what kinds of interplay may be detected between the parallel learning cycles of the home care client and the home care worker, and what the characteristics of defensive learning are. The data consist of 30 videotaped home care visits. The learning cycles of the encounters were found to be either predominantly defensive or expansive, which led to the identification of 4 basic types of combined learning cycles. Encounters in which the client’s and the worker’s cycles were aligned tended to contain fewer learning actions than encounters in which the cycles moved to opposite directions. The latter types of encounters were characterized by subtle orientational mismatches that left matters open and invoked further elaboration by the client and the worker. Defensive cycles were more reflective than expected and seemed to involve aspects of agency that are not commonly acknowledged.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2017.1412970,[theory] (Cultural-Historical) Activity Theory (CHAT); [theory] Expansive Learning,[method] Activity System Analysis,,,,,,[construct] agency,"Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT), Expansive Learning Theory,activity system analysis, ethnographic case study,Workplace Learning, Expansive Learning Interventions,healthcare practice, home care workplace,expansive learning, contradiction, agency, transformation, practice",[theory] (Cultural-Historical) Activity Theory (CHAT); [theory] Expansive Learning; [method] Activity System Analysis; ; ; ; ; ; [construct] agency,,

A study was conducted for 6 months in 3 sections of a 7th-grade social studies classroom in which 30 students discussed and wrote about current events. One section served as a comparison group. Over time the experimental group made more arguments that integrated both sides of each issue. Collectively, the experimental group also successfully constructed salient critical questions, particularly in regard to weighing values and designing practical creative solutions. In-depth analysis of 1 student showed how conceptual structures and argument practices improved incrementally over time and how the appropriation of stratagems may have been facilitated by the dialectical nature of the intervention (e.g., using critical questions and stratagems successfully in discourse).

Our starting point for the partnership focused on an 8-hour introductory composites course that was designed for company employees. In phase one, learning scientists observed the company's course development activities and the course as taught by company experts. In phase two, we collaboratively designed and implemented a quasi-experimental study comparing two approaches to teaching. One involved lectures with PowerPoint slides. The second, a “challenge-based” learning approach, combined a set of composites-relevant challenges with individual, small-group, and large-group collaborative inquiry. Comparisons between these methods showed greater interaction among participants in the challenge-based group. In addition, the challenge-based group performed significantly better on posttest items requiring integration and synthesis of concepts. Increased interactivity in the challenge course provided opportunities for participants to articulate connections among concepts and may have contributed to the challenge participants' better synthesis of learned concepts.

396,Knowing When You've Brought Them in: Scientific Genre Knowledge and Communities of Practice,O'Neill,2001,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Increasingly, researchers in the learning sciences are appealing to notions of community to shape the design of learning technologies and curricular innovations. Many of these designs, including those in the area of project-based science, show strong promise; but, it is a challenging matter to understand the influences of these innovations in a detailed enough fashion to refine them over time. This work demands sensitive, theoretically grounded ways to assess the depth to which particular facets of innovations help enculturate students into communities of discourse and practice. Taking genre theory and the sociology of science as points of departure, I demonstrate a unique approach to the problems of developing and assessing students' understanding of persuasive practices in the scientific community. The research I discuss revolves around students' use of a professional scientific genre of scientific writing, the Research Article or Introduction, Methods, Results, Discission (IMRD) report (Swales, 1990), as they compose reports about their own original research. Using data from an innovative project-based high school science class, I demonstrate how genre use provides a window on the effectiveness of a learning environment in helping use discipline-specific tools of persuasion. In the classroom studied here, students developed e-mail mentoring relationships with volunteer scientists across the United States and Canada. Working in partnership with the teacher, these ""telementors"" served not only as inquiry guides for students, but also as a critical audience that helped shape the arguments they made about their research. Detailed analysis of the final reports produced by teams of students in the class revealed a significant relation between their fulfillment of the customary persuasive functions of a scientific research article and sustained correspondence with their telementors. A significant relation was also observed between sustained dialogue with telementors and careful hedging of knowledge claims. I situate these findings within a body of theory that suggests the value of telementoring relationships consists not only the ongoing advice and guidance they furnish, but in the ways that a professional audience shapes students' ideas about the sorts of arguments that are called for in science class. Because the analysis of genre use is a relatively noninvasive way to examine students' understandings of scientific persuasion (as compared with survey instruments or pull-out interviews), this method can serve as a useful tool for reformers wishing to compare the outcomes from iterations or conditions of design experiments that aim to develop students' understanding of persuasive practices in the scientific community. It may also make a useful transfer measure for a wide range of classroom innovations that aim to cultivate scientific reasoning and persuasion, such as science-oriented tools for computer-supported collaborative learning.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1003_1,[theory] Communities of Practice; [theory] Genre Theory; [theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] Case Study Research; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Qualitative Inquiry,[pedagogy] Communities of Practice,,,[subject] science,,[construct] communication; [construct] identity; [construct] participation,",communities of practice,genre theory,sociocultural theory,,,discourse analysis,case study,qualitative analysis,,,,secondary education,science education,writing in science,,,scientific writing,genre knowledge,participation,identity,communication practices,",[theory] Communities of Practice; [theory] Genre Theory; [theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] Case Study Research; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Qualitative Inquiry; [pedagogy] Communities of Practice; ; ; [subject] science; ; [construct] communication; [construct] identity; [construct] participation,,

However, theoretical frameworks for understanding how students learn to use computation as a disciplinary tool are currently underdeveloped.MethodsIn this study, we propose computational literacy as a productive theoretical lens on this subject, with a particular focus on how people engage with and write computational literature. This theory views computation as a literacy consisting of material, cognitive, and social elements, to which we add the notion of computational literature that has epistemic and communicative aspects. We use this perspective, operationalized through both narrative case study and conjecture mapping methodologies, to analyze the cases of two pairs of students writing computational essays in an intermediate physics course.FindingsThrough these case studies we see the pairs leveraging elements of their existing computational literacy to both engage with and produce computational literature in their discipline. This, in turn, helps them to adopt the practices of computational scientists and deepen their computational literacy.ContributionThis study shows the usefulness of computational literacy as a framework for understanding computational learning within a discipline and elaborates on the role that computational literature plays in that process.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2025.2494791,,[method] Case Study Research; [method] coding and categorization; [method] Conjecture Mapping; [method] Narrative Inquiry,[pedagogy] Conjecture Mapping Framework; [pedagogy] Constructionism,,,[subject] computer science / programming; [subject] physics,[technology] computational literacy,,",computational literacy,literacy theory,conjecture mapping,,,narrative inquiry,case study,conjecture mapping,qualitative inquiry,,,,undergraduate education,physics education,,,computational essays,disciplinary practices,epistemic communication,coding practices,",; [method] Case Study Research; [method] coding and categorization; [method] Conjecture Mapping; [method] Narrative Inquiry; [pedagogy] Conjecture Mapping Framework; [pedagogy] Constructionism; ; ; [subject] computer science / programming; [subject] physics; [technology] computational literacy; ,,

In contrast to theories that focus on individuals as actors, the systemic-constructivist approach emphasizes the relevance of social systems and regards the construction of knowledge as a self-referential process that takes place in social systems. We propose that it is the system that defines what is accepted as legitimate knowledge and thus shapes individuals’ behavior. We present this approach and its implications by providing a case study of knowledge construction in Wikipedia. We analyzed the article about the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant shortly after the nuclear catastrophe unfolded. There was a flood of highly uncertain information circulating, which the social system Wikipedia had to deal with and make meaning of. We obtained a group of very diverse people who largely lacked specific background education on the topic but accomplished the collaborative creation of an article that was later considered by experts to be of high quality. By interpreting these occurrences as operations of a social system, we aim to extend the theoretical basis of the learning sciences with an approach that emphasizes systems and their structures instead of individuals or groups.

403,Learning by Teaching Human Pupils and Teachable Agents: The Importance of Recursive Feedback,Okita & Schwartz,2013,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Feedback is important for learning. However, there are different types of feedback, and not all feedback is effective. Here we introduce recursive feedback (RF), which occurs when tutors observe their pupils use what they have been taught. Two experiments examined the value of RF during learning by teaching. In the first study adults taught another adult face to face about human biology. Those participants who observed their pupil interact with an examiner exhibited superior learning relative to individuals in several control conditions that included elements of learning by teaching but not RF. The second study examined whether RF benefits extend to teaching computerized teachable agents in regular classrooms. High school students played games in which they induced logical rules. Students taught their agent the governing rules. They received RF when they observed their teachable agent play a prediction game against a second competitor agent. On a posttest, these students exhibited greater abilities to use logic to solve novel problems compared to students in control conditions who received direct feedback by playing against the competitor agent themselves.

404,It takes two to tango: How scientific reasoning and self-regulation processes impact argumentation quality,Omarchevska et al.,2021,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Improving scientific reasoning and argumentation are central aims of science education. Because of their complex nature, self-regulation is important for successful scientific reasoning. This study provides a first attempt to investigate how scientific reasoning and self-regulation processes conjointly impact argumentation quality.MethodsIn a study with university students (N = 30), we used fine-grained process data of scientific reasoning and self-regulation during inquiry learning to investigate how the co-occurrences between scientific reasoning and self-regulation processes are associated with argumentation quality.FindingsWhen modeling the co-occurrence of scientific reasoning and self-regulation processes using epistemic network analysis, differences between students showing either high or low argumentation quality become apparent. Students who showed high argumentation quality engaged in different scientific reasoning processes together more often than students with low argumentation quality, and they made more connections between self-regulation and scientific reasoning processes.ContributionThese findings offer educational implications for teaching scientific reasoning. Integrating self-regulation and scientific reasoning during instruction could be beneficial for improving scientific reasoning and argumentation.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2021.1966633,[theory] Argumentation Theory,,,,[setting] secondary education,[subject] science,,[construct] argumentation; [construct] collaboration,"Self-Regulated Learning Framework, Scientific Argumentation Theory,mixed methods experimental study, discourse coding analysis,Argumentation Pedagogy, Metacognitive Scaffolding,science education, secondary classrooms,argumentation, reasoning, regulation, collaboration, epistemic talk",[theory] Argumentation Theory; ; ; ; [setting] secondary education; [subject] science; ; [construct] argumentation; [construct] collaboration,,
405,Concreteness Fading of Algebraic Instruction: Effects on Learning,Ottmar & Landy,2016,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Learning algebra is difficult for many students in part because of an emphasis on the memorization of abstract rules. Algebraic reasoners across expertise levels often rely on perceptual-motor strategies to make these rules meaningful and memorable. However, in many cases, rules are provided as patterns to be memorized verbally, with little overt perceptual support. Although most work on concreteness focuses on conceptual support through examples or analogies, here we consider notational concreteness—perceptual-motor supports that provide access into the dynamic structure of a representation itself. We hypothesize that perceptual support may be maximally beneficial as an initial scaffold to learning so that later static symbol use may be interpreted using a dynamic perspective. This hypothesis meshes with other findings using concrete analogies or examples, which often find that fading these supports over time leads to stronger learning outcomes. In an experiment exploring this hypothesis, we compared gains from the fading out of dynamic concrete physical motion of symbols during instruction with the introduction of motion over the course of instruction. In line with our theoretical perspective, concreteness fading led to significantly better achievement than concreteness introduction after Day 2 of the intervention.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2016.1250212,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,
406,"The Problem of Transfer, and the Sociocultural Critique of Schooling",Packer,2001,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"It is often suggested that transfer is central to our system of education. Yet transfer has proven hard to define, difficult to investigate, and perplexingly controversial. This article compares 1 of the earliest critiques of transfer- Dewey's (1916)-with 1 of the most recent-Lave's (1988)-to explore how the debate over transfer is linked to competing views of the goals and aims of schooling. It is proposed that if sociocultural theory is to make good on its critique of schooling, it must be extended in 2 respects: in its ontology of the person, and its conception of the society in which we live. A preliminary sketch is provided of each of these extensions, to develop the sociocultural suggestion that learning and schooling both involve transformation of the person. The debate over transfer rests on but obscures divergent views of the goals and aims of schooling. Both critique of schooling and calls for school reform presuppose conceptions of the kind of person we want children to be, and the kind of society we wish to foster.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1004new_4,[theory] Critical Pedagogy; [theory] Deweyan Pragmatism / Deweyan Philosophy; [theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] conceptual modeling,,,[setting] public schooling,,,[construct] transfer,",sociocultural theory,Deweyan philosophy,critical psychology,,,theoretical analysis,historical comparison,,,,schooling,learning sciences,,,transfer,critique of schooling,personhood,transformation,educational aims,",[theory] Critical Pedagogy; [theory] Deweyan Pragmatism / Deweyan Philosophy; [theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] conceptual modeling; ; ; [setting] public schooling; ; ; [construct] transfer,,
407,Curiosity to Question: Tracing productive engagement in an interdisciplinary course-based research experience,Papendieck & Clarke,2024,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Course-based research experiences (CBREs) are highly valued for science learning and research. Most are discipline-centered, but there is a great deal of interest in developing them to promote interdisciplinarity. Yet, we have much to learn about how CBREs work, and even more to learn about how disciplinary diversity operates as an element of design to promote learning and research.MethodThis mixed methods case study triangulates data on student experience, research networks, research artifacts and fieldnotes from participant observation to understand how disciplinary diversity factors into productive engagement for learning and research in an interdisciplinary course-based research experience (I-CBRE).FindingsA common boundary object (scientific paper) mediated developmental interactions among individuals both within and beyond the course. The boundary object also facilitated the productive engagement of students as instrumental actors in broader interdisciplinary research networks.ContributionThis study shows how an “object tracing” approach can be used to examine productivity in disciplinarily diverse scientific contexts, and reveals some of the distinctly syncretic moves that participants deploy to make progress as learners and researchers. Extending work by Engel and Conant, the study emphasizes the importance of designing for “productive syncretic engagement” in research experiences characterized disciplinary diversity.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2024.2347597,,[method] Case Study Research; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] multimodal analysis,[pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL),,[setting] higher education,,,[construct] agency; [construct] curiosity; [construct] engagement; [construct] epistemic agency; [construct] Epistemic Agency; [construct] epistemic stance,",curiosity framework,epistemic agency,inquiry-based learning,,,discourse analysis,case study,multimodal analysis,,,,undergraduate education,interdisciplinary research course,higher education,,,curiosity,engagement,inquiry practices,epistemic stance,research-based learning,",; [method] Case Study Research; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] multimodal analysis; [pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL); ; [setting] higher education; ; ; [construct] agency; [construct] curiosity; [construct] engagement; [construct] epistemic agency; [construct] Epistemic Agency; [construct] epistemic stance,,

Technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR) designed to reveal pets’ sensory worlds and companionship with pets can facilitate learners’ harmonious relationships with significant others in naturecultures.MethodsAt a two-week virtual summer camp, we engaged teens in inquiring into dogs’ and cats’ senses using selective color filters, investigations, experience design projects, and understanding how the umwelt (von Uexküll, 2001) of pets impacts their lives with humans. We qualitatively analyzed participants’ talk, extensive notes, and projects completed at the workshop.FindingsWe found that teens engaged in the science and engineering practices of planning and carrying out investigations, constructing explanations and designing solutions, and questioning while investigating specific aspects of their pets’ lives. Further, we found that teens checking and taking pets’ perspectives while caring for them shaped their productive engagement in these practices.

410,What Does “Fast” Mean? Understanding the Physical World Through Computational Representations,Parnafes,2007,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article concerns the development of conceptual understanding of a physical phenomenon through the use of computational representations. It examines how students make sense of and interpret computational representations, and how their understanding of the represented physical phenomenon develops in this process. Eight studies were conducted, in which pairs of students were engaged in an exploratory activity of natural harmonic oscillation. They first explored physical oscillators (e.g., springs, pendulums) and then interacted with dynamic and interactive computational representations that represent aspects of natural harmonic oscillation. The analysis focuses on selected episodes demonstrating critical steps in the development of the students' understanding. It offers a detailed description of these steps and closely examines students' interaction with various features of the representations in order to identify the relations between use of representations and students' developing understanding. A theory of conceptual change, coordination class theory (diCitationSessa & Sherin, 1998), is used to track the development process of students' understanding with representations. The detailed analysis aims to construct a model describing mechanisms of developing understanding through the mediation of computational representations. The significance of this study is in its close look at the detailed process of learning and conceptual change in computational environments.First and foremost, I amindebted to my advisor, Andrea diSessa, for his extensive support and guidance in framing and developing this research.

We focus on the strengths and weaknesses of each learning method and describe how they can be integrated in a complementary fashion. The goal of this integration is to provide a learning architecture that accounts for the effects of prior knowledge on human learning. The integration helps to explain how a learner can learn rapidly when new experiences are consistent with prior knowledge while still retaining the ability to learn in novel domains (although more slowly). In addition, we present experimental evidence that an integrated model converges on accurate concepts more rapidly than either method applied individually.

Relying on data from surveys and independent ratings of naturally occurring teacher assignments, we used hierarchical linear modeling techniques to analyze the impacts of the professional development on how teachers planned and coordinated instruction.

We used an established sorting task to gather youth perspectives of the tools as identity texts through design markers of gendered identities within the toolkits. We examined the relationship between learning outcomes and the gendered design components of the toolkits.FindingsToolkits that privilege feminine or artistic elements significantly impacted learning more than traditional toolkits used in schools, which showed little to no significant learning gains. We relate this to the inextricability of materiality and the gendered identities of these tools and materials.ContributionThis study shows how arts-based or feminine-coded tools can be more effective for teaching and learning, serving as a counter to common resistance to adopting such tools and materials for STEM learning.

Through the analysis of a classroom discussion on the use of militarized drones in an undergraduate engineering ethics course, we show how ideological convergence among participants constructed locally significant categories of “civilian,” “terrorist,” and (un)grievability, which narrowed the possible trajectories for students’ disciplinary learning in engineering and engineering ethics. Our analysis also shows that fleeting moments of ideological expansion offered opportunities for new learning; however, most of these instances of possibility were not sustained through the classroom discussion.

423,Digital Youth Divas: Exploring Narrative-Driven Curriculum to Spark Middle School Girls’ Interest in Computational Activities,Pinkard et al.,2017,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Women use technology to mediate numerous aspects of their professional and personal lives. Yet, few design and create these technologies given that women, especially women of color, are grossly underrepresented in computer science and engineering courses. Decisions about participation in STEM are frequently made prior to high school, and these decisions are impacted by prior experience, interest, and sense of fit with community. Digital Youth Divas is an out-of-school program that uses narrative stories to launch the creation of digital artifacts and support non-dominant middle school girls’ STEM interests and identities through virtual and real-world community. In this article, we discuss the framework of the Digital Youth Divas environment, including our approach to blending narratives into project-based design challenges through on- and offline mechanisms. Results from our pilot year, including the co-design process with the middle school participants, suggest that our narrative-centered, blended learning program design sparks non-dominant girls’ interests in STEM activities and disciplinary identification, and has the potential to mediate girls’ sense of STEM agency, identities, and interests.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2017.1307199,[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Identity Theory,[method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Mixed Methods,[pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR),,,,,[construct] gender; [construct] identity; [construct] interest; [construct] narrative; [construct] participation,"Identity Theory, Feminist HCI, Narrative Learning Theory,design-based research, mixed methods,Narrative-Based Curriculum, Equity-Oriented STEM Learning,computer science education, after-school digital learning program,narrative, identity, gender, interest, participation",[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Identity Theory; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Mixed Methods; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); ; ; ; ; [construct] gender; [construct] identity; [construct] interest; [construct] narrative; [construct] participation,,
424,Learning to Relate Qualitative and Quantitative Problem Representations in a Model-Based Setting for Collaborative Problem Solving,Ploetzner et al.,1999,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"In an experimental study, we investigated how 10th graders acquire, extend, and successively relate knowledge about qualitative and quantitative aspects of classical mechanics. The study was made up of 2 main phases. In the 1st phase, students were taught either qualitative or quantitative aspects of classical mechanics by means of 2 different instructional units. In both units, concept maps were used for the presentation of information. In the 2nd phase, dyads were formed with students who worked on different instructional units and thus possessed systematically different knowledge. The 2 students collaboratively worked on problems that were beyond the competence of each of them and demanded the coordinated useof knowledge about qualitative and quantitative aspects. Before and after the instruction as well as after the collaborative problem solving, students had to work on multicomponent tests. In addition, during the collaborative problem solving, protocols were taken of the students' mutual exchange of information An analysis of the multicomponent tests revealed that qualitative as well as quantitative knowledge can successfully be taught by means of concept maps. Students who initially were taught qualitative aspects of physics gained significantly more from the information provided by their quantitatively instructed partners during the collaborative problem solving than the other way around. An analysis of individual problem-solving attempts uncovered that students learned to construct increasingly more complete qualitative and quantitative problem representations. An explorative protocol analysis of the students' dialogues further indicated that the students gradually shifted their focus from quantitative to qualitative problem representations during collaborative problem solving.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0802_1,[theory] Cognitive Apprenticeship; [theory] Model-Based Reasoning,[method] experimental design; [method] Mixed Methods,[pedagogy] Cognitive Apprenticeship; [pedagogy] Collaborative Learning,,[setting] higher education,[subject] physics; [subject] science,[technology] computer-based instruction,[construct] collaboration; [construct] reasoning; [construct] representations,",model-based reasoning,collaborative learning,cognitive apprenticeship,,,experimental study,computer-based learning environment,mixed methods,,,,higher education,physics education,science education,,,model building,qualitative reasoning,quantitative reasoning,collaboration,representational competence,representations",[theory] Cognitive Apprenticeship; [theory] Model-Based Reasoning; [method] experimental design; [method] Mixed Methods; [pedagogy] Cognitive Apprenticeship; [pedagogy] Collaborative Learning; ; [setting] higher education; [subject] physics; [subject] science; [technology] computer-based instruction; [construct] collaboration; [construct] reasoning; [construct] representations,,
425,Mastery and Appropriation as Means to Understand the Interplay of History Learning and Identity Trajectories,Polman,2006,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article uses a sociocultural approach to analyze how trajectories of identity development and learning intersect in actions carried out in a community of learners. The approach utilizes a framework for analysis with 5 aspects: the action, the agents, the goals, the cultural tools, and the scene. The study posits a distinction between mastery of the cultural tools of a discipline—in this case history—and the appropriation of those tools to relate to learners' identities and the likelihood for learners to use tools outside the context in which they are learned. The study uses the framework to analyze 2 particular moments of action within a set of project-based, after school clubs inquiring into the history of resistance to slavery. One action, which advanced a youth's identity as a history learner and participation in practices of historical inquiry, was enabled by successfully building on his identity and expertise as a computer ""gamer."" Another youth's school identity and the norms of his school constrained his action during the after school club in important ways, limiting his opportunities for learning and identity development.

This article reflects on what the pandemic experience has meant for some RPPs so far, and imagines what other RPPs might look like in the near future. The authors share a collection of fifteen think-pieces written by individuals working in or around, or funding RPPs during the COVID crisis. These contributions include reflections on how the pandemic affected existing RPPs and how teams responded to the disruptions, how the larger context in which RPPs operate matters, as well as how RPPs can help us build a more just and united society. The authors identify lessons to be drawn from across these think-pieces and implications for the field, and close with a call for action about learning scientists’ possibilities for belonging to RPPs.

Accounts of co-design rarely examine educators’ affective and relational experiences, nor investigate scaffolds for creating humanizing environments. We asked: How did affect and relationship show up in co-design for educators?, How did the affirmation of affect and relationship in the co-design process support the movement of ideas and practices across scales of practice?, How did the movement of ideas and practices facilitate the expansion of the object (to design a compassion course)?MethodsWe analyzed meeting transcripts, field notes, artifacts, interviews, and reflections from a co-design project where educators and researchers developed a course sequence on compassion and dignity in schools.FindingsEducators discussed affective experiences, including those connected to challenging interactions. Discussing obstacles to compassion contributed to strengthening the co-design community and educators’ positive experience of co-design. Attention to affective experiences supported educators to connect compassion to their lives, invited learning across scales of practice, and expanded their vision for shared work.ContributionAttention to affective and relational aspects of co-design strengthens engagement in the co-design process, inviting more equitable participation and creating humanizing design environments, and thus should be a central component of participatory work.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2024.2318557,[theory] Affect Theory; [theory] Participatory Design,[method] Co-Design / Co-Creation Research; [method] Collaborative Design Research; [method] Equity-Centered Design Research; [method] Participatory Design Research; [method] thematic analysis,[pedagogy] Equity-Centered Design; [pedagogy] Participatory Learning,,[setting] teacher education; [setting] teacher professional development,,,[construct] affect; [construct] emotion; [construct] relationship,",participatory design,co-design,affect theory,,,participatory design sessions,qualitative inquiry,reflexive / reflective synthesis,thematic analysis,,,,professional development,educational design,collaborative research,,,affect,emotion,relational ethics,co-creation,equity-centered design,teacher education,",[theory] Affect Theory; [theory] Participatory Design; [method] Co-Design / Co-Creation Research; [method] Collaborative Design Research; [method] Equity-Centered Design Research; [method] Participatory Design Research; [method] thematic analysis; [pedagogy] Equity-Centered Design; [pedagogy] Participatory Learning; ; [setting] teacher education; [setting] teacher professional development; ; ; [construct] affect; [construct] emotion; [construct] relationship,,
429,The Microevolution of Mathematical Knowledge: The Case of Randomness,Pratt & Noss,2002,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"In this article, we explore the growth of mathematical knowledge and in particular, seek to clarify the relation between abstraction and context. Our method is to gain a deeper appreciation of the process by which mathematical abstraction is achieved and the nature of abstraction itself, by connecting our analysis at the level of observation with a corresponding theoretical analysis at an appropriate grain size. In this article, we build on previous work to take a further step toward constructing a viable model of the microevolution of mathematical knowledge in context.The theoretical model elaborated here is grounded in data drawn from a study of 10 to 11 year olds' construction of meanings for randomness in the context of a carefully designed computational microworld, whose central feature was the visibility of its mechanisms-how the random behavior of objects actually ""worked."" In this article, we illustrate the theory by reference to a single case study chosen to illuminate the relation between the situation (including, crucially, its tools and tasks) and the emergence of new knowledge. Our explanation will employ the notion of situated abstraction as an explanatory device that attempts to synthesize existing micro- and macrolevel descriptions of knowledge construction. One implication will be that the apparent dichotomy between mathematical knowledge as decontextualized or highly situated can be usefully resolved as affording different perspectives on a broadening of contextual neighborhood over which a network of knowledge elements applies.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1104_2,[theory] Cognitive Development; [theory] Constructionism; [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR),[method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] longitudinal study,[pedagogy] Constructionism; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR),[population] middle school,,[subject] mathematics,[technology] computer-based instruction,[construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] epistemology,",constructionism,emergent modeling,epistemological analysis,,,design-based research,longitudinal case study,,,,middle school,mathematics education,,,randomness,modeling,conceptual development,computer-based learning environment,",[theory] Cognitive Development; [theory] Constructionism; [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] longitudinal study; [pedagogy] Constructionism; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [population] middle school; ; [subject] mathematics; [technology] computer-based instruction; [construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] epistemology,,

This study compared 2 enactments of an inquiry curriculum, then examined students' learning outcomes in classes taught by 2 teachers. The quantitative data show that there were significant differences in the learning outcomes of students in classes of the 2 teachers. This study then examined classroom enactments by the 2 teachers to understand the differences in the learning outcomes. This research specifically focused on how teacher-led discussions (a) helped connect the activities within a curriculum unit and (b) enabled deeper conceptual understanding by helping students make connections between science concepts and principles.

435,Web-based Collaborative Inquiry to Bridge Gaps in Secondary Science Education,Raes et al.,2013,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"As secondary students’ interest in science is decreasing, schools are faced with the challenging task of providing adequate instruction to engage students—and more particularly the disadvantaged students—to learn science and improve their science inquiry skills. In this respect, the integration of Web-based collaborative inquiry can be seen as a possible answer. However, the differential effects of Web-based inquiry on disadvantaged students have barely been studied. To bridge this gap, this study deals with the implementation of a Web-based inquiry project in 19 secondary classes and focuses specifically on gender, achievement level, and academic track. Multilevel analysis was applied to uncover the effects on knowledge acquisition, inquiry skills, and interest in science. The study provides quantitative evidence not only that a Web-based collaborative inquiry project is an effective approach for science learning, but that this approach can also offer advantages for students who are not typically successful in science or who are not enrolled in a science track. This approach can contribute to narrowing the gap between boys and girls in science and can give low-achieving students and general-track students an opportunity to develop confidence and skills for learning science, bringing them to a performance level that is closer to that of high-achieving students.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2013.836656,,[method] Collaborative Inquiry; [method] experimental design; [method] Mixed Methods,[pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL); [pedagogy] Scaffolding,,,[subject] digital literacy; [subject] science,[technology] digital literacy,[construct] collaboration; [construct] engagement; [construct] scaffolding,"Inquiry-Based Learning, Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), Socio-Constructivism,experimental design, mixed methods,Collaborative Inquiry, Online Inquiry-Based Learning,science education, secondary education, web-based learning,collaboration, inquiry, engagement, scaffolding, digital literacy",; [method] Collaborative Inquiry; [method] experimental design; [method] Mixed Methods; [pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL); [pedagogy] Scaffolding; ; ; [subject] digital literacy; [subject] science; [technology] digital literacy; [construct] collaboration; [construct] engagement; [construct] scaffolding,,

To that end the nature of the interaction among four girls in a small group science activity is analyzed with respect to the other work on both girls' talk and on small group interactions. It is shown that three participants obtained very different access to this conversation from their usual access to whole class lessons. It is further shown that the student whose participation in the small group differed most from that of the others had a different orientation to the task and indicated she was playing by different conversational rules. Co-construction is then explored as a major means of interaction for the other three participants, but the question posed is to what extent this form is necessarily collaborative.

We analyze teachers’ professional conversations to understand how dialogues can expand teachers’ conceptualizations.Methods: We examine professional dialogues from nine whole-school intervention meetings. Drawing on discursive psychology and activity theoretical notions of learning the study conceptualizes teachers’ collective assumptions as a lived ideology actively sustained by stabilization discourses. We analyze the discursive devices through which the teachers’ talk about their students limits/expands their sense of what is possible in their teaching and their dialogic effects.Findings: Our analysis finds a range of discursive strategies that sustain or re-stabilize the lived ideology. Even when challenged by contrary evidence (e.g., surprises), dilemmatic tensions and reframing repair actions are found to close potential dialogic openings. Importantly, we identify a form of discourse that avoids immediate closure, characterized by sustained reflection on the students’ challenges developing a need to change. We term this reflexive noticing: it is enabled through sustained puzzle, constructing dilemmas as origin of change and discursive consciousness of stabilization.Contribution: We illustrate why contrary evidence often fails to shift limiting conceptualizations about students and show the discursive mechanisms generating possibility knowledge.

443,Implementation as distributed sensemaking and adaptation: Understanding how an interest-driven STEAM learning environment maintains integrity across diverse contexts,Ramey & Stevens,2025,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Much of learning sciences research focuses on the design of learning innovations. However, curricula developed by learning scientists are seldomly widely adopted. One reason is that scaling programs beyond local, carefully tended contexts is difficult and is often unsuccessful. This problem suggests a need for research aimed at understanding how learning innovations scale beyond initial implementations.MethodsWe take a distributed sensemaking approach to analyzing the micro-level processes through which actors make sense of and align themselves with new programs. We examine one learning innovation, FUSE Studios, an integrated suite of STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math) learning activities, which has spread from two afterschool implementations to over 250, primarily in-school implementations. We present an analysis of classroom video and interviews with students and teachers from 17 focal schools, including a detailed case analysis of one school.FindingsOur findings demonstrate how distributed sensemaking and adaptation among networks of humans and non-humans shaped local implementations and how, despite local adaptations, the program was able to maintain integrity of implementation, delivering similar experiences to students across contexts.ContributionThese findings improve our understanding of how learning innovations scale and demonstrate the value of a distributed sensemaking perspective on implementation processes.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2025.2548546,[theory] Actor-Network Theory (ANT); [theory] Distributed Cognition; [theory] Distributed Sensemaking,[method] cross-case analysis; [method] Ethnography; [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [method] interview methods,,,[setting] K–12 education,[subject] STEAM,,[construct] adaptability; [construct] distributed cognition,",distributed sensemaking,actor-network theory,distributed cognition,,,video analysis,interviews,cross-case analysis,ethnography,,,,STEAM learning,afterschool program,K-12 schools,educational innovation implementation,,,implementation integrity,scaling learning innovations,FUSE Studios,adaptation,networked actors,",[theory] Actor-Network Theory (ANT); [theory] Distributed Cognition; [theory] Distributed Sensemaking; [method] cross-case analysis; [method] Ethnography; [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [method] interview methods; ; ; [setting] K–12 education; [subject] STEAM; ; [construct] adaptability; [construct] distributed cognition,,
442,Making Sense of Space: Distributed Spatial Sensemaking in a Middle School Summer Engineering Camp,Ramey & Uttal,2017,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Spatial thinking is important for success in engineering. However, little is known about how students learn and apply spatial skills, particularly in kindergarten to Grade 12 engineering learning. The present study investigated the role of spatial thinking in engineering learning at a middle school summer camp. Participants were 26 students (13 female, 13 male), predominantly from underrepresented groups. We took a cognitive ethnographic approach, using observations of hands-on engineering learning activities to identify moments when spatial problems arose and how learners made sense of these problems. We describe these processes as distributed spatial sensemaking because they involved both internal (cognitive) processes and also interactions with other learners, materials, and representations. We identified 90 distributed spatial sensemaking episodes in our data set. These episodes facilitated important engineering practices such as hypothesis testing and design iteration. We also found that different activities elicited different types of distributed spatial sensemaking episodes. Our results demonstrate how spatial thinking matters in everyday engineering learning and speaks to the types of engineering learning activities that scaffold particular spatial processes and practices. Our research also shows how cognitive, situated, and distributed theories can be used in tandem to make sense of a complex phenomenon like engineering learning.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2016.1277226,,[method] Ethnography,[pedagogy] Project-Based Learning (PjBL),[population] middle school,,[subject] engineering,,,"[theory] Distributed Sensemaking, [theory] Cognitive Theory, [theory] Situated Learning,ethnography, coding and categorization,[pedagogy] Scaffolding, [pedagogy] Project-Based Learning (PjBL),[population] students, [population] middle school, underrepresented groups, camp, engineering,[construct] spatial reasoning, [construct] sensemaking, [construct] discussion, [construct] gesture",; [method] Ethnography; [pedagogy] Project-Based Learning (PjBL); [population] middle school; ; [subject] engineering; ; ,,

445,Adaptive support for representational competencies during technology-based problem solving in chemistry,Rau et al.,2021,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: : A key aspect of STEM learning is the use of visual representations for problem solving. To successfully use visuals, students need to make sense of how they show concepts and to fluently perceive domain-relevan information in them. Adding support for sense making and perceptual fluency to problem-solving activities enhances students’ learning of content knowledge. However, students need different types of representational-competency supports, depending on their prior knowledge. This suggests that adaptively assigning students to sense-makingand perceptual-fluency support might be more effective than assigning all students to the same sequence of these supports.Method: We tested this hypothesis in an experiment with 44 undergraduate students in a chemistry course. Students were randomly assigned to a ten-week sequence of problem-solving activities that either provided a fixed sequence of sense-making support and perceptual-fluency support or adaptively assigned these supports based on students’ problem-solving interactions.Findings: Results show that adaptive representational-competency supports reduced students’ confusion and mistakes during problem solving while increasing their learning of content knowledge.Contribution: Our study is the first to show that adaptive support for representational competencies can significantly enhance learning of content knowledge.

Formal principles are presented with several examples from different topics, and students choose the one that interests them most. Example choice might be related to prior knowledge, interest, or perceived control. In an experimental study, we examined the effects of degree of example choice and degree of prior knowledge on interest, perceived control, and learning outcomes in a presentation on confirmation bias. The main finding was that participants who could choose an example showed more interest in the presentation of the formal principle than participants who either were given an example by the experimenter or only saw the presentation. Control was lowest for the group without example choice and without prior knowledge. Finally, prior knowledge, but not example choice, increased performance on a transfer of knowledge task. Example choice thus offers a new approach for closing the gap between formal principles as presented at school and a student's interests.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400903191896,[theory] Cognitive Psychology,[method] experimental design,[pedagogy] Example-Based Learning,,[setting] higher education,,,[construct] autonomy; [construct] control; [construct] engagement; [construct] interest; [construct] learning outcomes,"Cognitive Psychology, Motivation Theory, Interest Development Framework,experimental design, quantitative analysis,Example-Based Learning,higher education, controlled lab and classroom studies,interest, autonomy, control, cognitive engagement, learning outcomes",[theory] Cognitive Psychology; [method] experimental design; [pedagogy] Example-Based Learning; ; [setting] higher education; ; ; [construct] autonomy; [construct] control; [construct] engagement; [construct] interest; [construct] learning outcomes,,
447,Modeling Individual Differences in Students' Learning Strategies,Recker & Pirolli,1995,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Learners employ a wide variety of strategies when faced with learning and problem solving in a new domain. The focus of this research is on learners' strategies when studying and explaining instructional materials to themselves prior to problem solving. In the first part of the article, we present results from an empirical study in which the learning and self-explanation strategies of subjects studying instructions embedded in a hypertext environment were contrasted with those from subjects learning with more standard, linear instruction. In the hypertext environment, instruction could be browsed in a nonlinear fashion, and the instructional examples were annotated with explanatory elaborations that students could choose to view. We present a Soar computational model that accounts for results from the study. A particular emphasis of the model was on capturing strategy differences between individual subjects. The general modeling approach involved coupling a model of individual subjects' interaction strategies with opportunities for action supported by the interfaces of the instructional environments. Specifically, by setting parameters, the model was fit to individual subject data. Analyses of subjects' simulations contribute several new results for understanding individual differences in strategy use and their role in learning. We show that clusters of subjects identified through analyses of model parameters continued to exhibit similar behaviors during subsequent problem solving, suggesting that the clusters corresponded to genuine strategy classes. Furthermore, these clusters appeared to represent general strategies that were, in some sense, adaptive to the task.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0401_1,[theory] ACT* Theory of Cognition; [theory] Cognitive Modeling,[method] Cognitive Modeling; [method] computational modeling,,,[setting] higher education,,[technology] computational modeling; [technology] computer-based instruction; [technology] simulations,[construct] metacognition,",cognitive modeling,learning strategies,ACT-R,,,computational modeling,simulation,experimental validation,,,,higher education,computer-based learning,,,individual differences,metacognition,self-regulated learning,model evaluation,",[theory] ACT* Theory of Cognition; [theory] Cognitive Modeling; [method] Cognitive Modeling; [method] computational modeling; ; ; [setting] higher education; ; [technology] computational modeling; [technology] computer-based instruction; [technology] simulations; [construct] metacognition,,

The fact that interdisciplinary learning is collaborative, long-lasting, and distributed necessitates using rich data sources and mainly qualitative forms of analysis. The impossibility of experimental comparisons led the researchers to adopt an ecological perspective, focusing on multi-level causal pathways rather than linear cause-and-effect relationships. Furthermore, I propose establishing an “object commons” for sharing research on interdisciplinary learning, suggesting metadata standards like PROV for describing digital provenance. Reconstructing the provenance of (digital) knowledge objects resembles historical analysis. I therefore explore further how narratives can serve as scientific explanations, drawing parallels between narrative structures and graph-based provenance notation. I argue for the refinement of narrative formats using digital provenance methods to enhance systematic analysis and sharing of research findings. In conclusion, addressing the methodological challenges that are indigenous to research on interdisciplinary learning has the potential to advance the methodology arsenal of the Learning Sciences and of educational research more generally.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2024.2354153,[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR),[method] COMMENTARY; [method] comparative analysis; [method] conceptual modeling; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR),[pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR),,[setting] higher education,,[technology] data science,[construct] collaboration; [construct] epistemic cognition,",epistemic network analysis,design-based research,learning sciences methodologies,,,comparative analysis,theoretical synthesis,methodological reflection,,,,interdisciplinary research,higher education,learning sciences,,,interdisciplinarity,methodology,design research,epistemic practices,collaboration,",[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] COMMENTARY; [method] comparative analysis; [method] conceptual modeling; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); ; [setting] higher education; ; [technology] data science; [construct] collaboration; [construct] epistemic cognition,,
450,Diving Into Complexity: Developing Probabilistic Decentralized Thinking Through Role-Playing Activities,Resnick & Wilensky,1998,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"There is a growing interest in role-playing activities, both in school classrooms and in the culture at large. Despite this growing interest, role-playing activities are rare in mathematics and science classrooms. In social-studies activities, a major goal is to help students adopt the perspective of another person. However, mathematics and science classes typically discourage this type of perspective-taking; science is usually taught as a process of detached observation and analysis of phenomena, not active participation within phenomena. In this article, we argue that role-playing activities can play a powerful role in mathematics and science education—particularly in the study of the new sciences of complexity. We present detailed descriptions and analyses of 2 role-playing activities that we have organized. Each activity is designed to help students explore (in a very participatory way) the behaviors of complex systems, helping them develop better intuitions on how complex phenomena can arise from simple interactions, and predictable patterns from random events.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0702_1,[theory] Complex Systems Theory; [theory] Constructionism; [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR),[method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Qualitative Inquiry,[pedagogy] Constructionism; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Participatory Learning,[population] middle school,,[subject] mathematics; [subject] science,[technology] computer-based modeling,,",constructionism,complexity theory,participatory learning,,,design-based research,classroom intervention,qualitative analysis,,,,middle school,mathematics education,science education,role-playing,,,decentralized thinking,complex systems,participatory modeling,syntonic learning,computer-based modeling,",[theory] Complex Systems Theory; [theory] Constructionism; [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Qualitative Inquiry; [pedagogy] Constructionism; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Participatory Learning; [population] middle school; ; [subject] mathematics; [subject] science; [technology] computer-based modeling; ,,

We investigated how students framed online evaluations while learning to read laterally, how students’ frames corresponded with their credibility assessments, and how teachers prompted and responded to students’ frames.FindingsWhile students frequently framed online evaluations as opportunities to check what credible others think through lateral reading, we found that students also frequently framed evaluation tasks as opportunities to gut check if the information made sense by relying on personal resources and weak heuristics. Students’ frames shifted as they had opportunities to practice lateral reading.

Using social network analysis and structural equation modeling, we contrasted pre/post network developments among 693 students (132 groups) across 4 modules at a UK business school. We examined whether it is better for students to invest in social relations in groups to learn and enhance academic performance or to (continue to) invest in social relations outside groups. Our findings indicated that students seemed to learn more from learning relations outside their group than from their own group members.

However, in the context of online problem-solving environments, it is still not entirely clear which help-seeking strategies are desired. We use fine-grained data from 38 high school students who worked with the Geometry Cognitive Tutor for 2 months to better understand the associations between specific help-seeking patterns and learning. We evaluate how students’ help-seeking behaviors on each step in a tutored problem are associated with their success on subsequent steps that require the same skills. Analyzing learning at the skill level allows us to compare different help-seeking patterns within a single student, controlling for between-student variations. Overall, asking for help on challenging steps is associated with productive learning, and overusing help is associated with poorer learning. However, contrary to many help-seeking theories, avoiding help (and failing repeatedly) is associated with better learning than seeking help on steps for which students have low prior knowledge. These results suggest that novice learners may benefit from engaging in solution attempts before they can make sense of given assistance.

Among many compelling societal interests that learning scientists can cite—such as increasing the quality of life, preparing citizens to make decisions in a complex world, and enhancing social cohesion among a diverse population—economic competitiveness is a compelling societal interest that resonates broadly among stakeholders. Indeed, it is now somewhat common to introduce learning sciences research, as in the Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences and the U.S. National Education Technology Plan, by citing economic rationales. Despite the utility of evoking a potential link between learning research and economic competitiveness in the minds of broader audiences, learning scientists engage in rather little critical discussion of whether such links are meaningful and empirically sound within their own programs of research.

On these views, researchers characterize individual students' epistemologies with single, coherent descriptions. Evidence of variability in student epistemologies, however, suggests the need for more complex models. Hammer and Elby (2002) proposed modeling personal epistemologies as comprised of manifold epistemological resources. This difference in ontology—the form research attributes to cognitive structure—accounts for variability: The activation of these epistemological resources depends on context. Our purpose in this article is to argue that it also accounts for coherences in student epistemologies, in particular for multiple local coherences. We advance this argument using a case study of a 15-min discussion by a group of eighth graders about the ""rock cycle"" (the cyclic transformations of rock among different forms). We begin with evidence of the students' working from a stable, coherent epistemological stance. Then, after a brief, purely epistemological intervention by the teacher, the evidence indicates they are working from a different but also coherent and stable epistemological stance.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls1502_4,[theory] Epistemic Cognition; [theory] Epistemology; [theory] Knowledge in Pieces,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Microgenetic Method,,,,,,[construct] epistemic cognition; [construct] epistemology; [construct] participation,"Epistemic Cognition, Knowledge in Pieces, Epistemological Resources Framework,case study research, discourse analysis, microgenetic analysis,Inquiry-Based Science Education (IBSE),earth science, middle school classrooms,epistemology, coherence, variability, reasoning, participation",[theory] Epistemic Cognition; [theory] Epistemology; [theory] Knowledge in Pieces; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Microgenetic Method; ; ; ; ; ; [construct] epistemic cognition; [construct] epistemology; [construct] participation,,
462,An Investigation of Problem Framing and Solving in a Grade 8 Open-Inquiry Science Program,Roth & Bowen,1994,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This study of learning in a Grade 8 open-inquiry science classroom focuses on the situated nature of students' problem framing and solving as they engaged in field research and the solving of contextual word problems, which we constructed from the students' own inquiries. The data sources included videotaped lessons, audiotaped interviews, and teacher-student interactions, and the artifacts constructed by students and teacher-researchers in the course of the study. Our analyses document and discuss the enormous work done by students in constructing research problems and resolving these problems through engaging in field research. During field research, many local problems emerged, which students learned to resolve interactionally with their peers and the settings. The students' framing of problems for research and work in the field setting stood in sharp contrast to their work on teacher-constructed, contextual word problems. These differences led us to a critical analysis of traditional word problems. The students' achievements in each of these situations emerged out of their interactions within a classroom community that encouraged independence, collaboration, and negotiation of meaning, and with the physical setting. Students' achievements and learning were meaningful because they were indexed to, and situated in, the setting of the students' experience.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0302_2,[theory] Distributed Cognition; [theory] Situated Cognition,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Microgenetic Method,[pedagogy] Collaborative Learning; [pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL),[population] middle school,,[subject] science,,[construct] distributed cognition,",situated cognition,inquiry-based learning,distributed cognition,,,ethnographic study,discourse analysis,microgenetic analysis,,,,middle school,science education,open inquiry,,,problem framing,scientific practices,collaborative reasoning,teacher scaffolding,",[theory] Distributed Cognition; [theory] Situated Cognition; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Microgenetic Method; [pedagogy] Collaborative Learning; [pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL); [population] middle school; ; [subject] science; ; [construct] distributed cognition,,
463,Art and Artifact of Children's Designing: A Situated Cognition Perspective,Roth,1996,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The purpose of this study was to investigate knowing and learning in an engineering design environment within an elementary classroom. Based on extensive ethnographic observation, video recordings, interviews with participants and observers, and children's design artifacts and engineering logbooks, fourth- and fifth-grade students' designing activities were interpreted from the perspective of situated cognition. The results show that children's designing was related to the artifacts, tools, materials, teacher-set constraints, and current trends in the setting. However, these elements cannot be taken as having some absolute ontology but are interpretively flexible. In the course of the engineering unit, the fourth- and fifth-grade students learned to exploit this interpretive flexibility to frame and solve problems. The emerging artifacts had at least two important functions: They were resources that structured the design process by both opening up possibilities and providing constraints, and they served to coordinate discursive and practical actions. The findings have important implications for affordances and constraints of learning environments in which designing is both a goal and a vehicle of instruction and for the evaluation of students' activities in such settings.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0502_2,[theory] (Cultural-Historical) Activity Theory (CHAT); [theory] Distributed Cognition; [theory] Situated Cognition,[method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] participant observation,[pedagogy] Design-Based Learning (DBL); [pedagogy] Learning-by-Design (LBD),[population] elementary education,,,,[construct] distributed cognition; [construct] meaning making,",situated cognition,design-based learning,activity theory,,,ethnographic observation,discourse analysis,artifact analysis,,,,elementary education,design projects,classroom learning,,,children’s design,tool use,materiality,meaning-making,distributed cognition,",[theory] (Cultural-Historical) Activity Theory (CHAT); [theory] Distributed Cognition; [theory] Situated Cognition; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] participant observation; [pedagogy] Design-Based Learning (DBL); [pedagogy] Learning-by-Design (LBD); [population] elementary education; ; ; ; [construct] distributed cognition; [construct] meaning making,,
464,"Differential Participation During Science Conversations: The Interaction of Focal Artifacts, Social Configurations, and Physical Arrangements",Roth et al.,1999,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Recent conceptualizations of knowing and learning focus on the degree of participation in the practices of communities. Discursive practices are the most important and characteristic practices in many communities. This study was designed to investigate how the content and form of classroom discourse was influenced by different combinations of artifacts (e.g., overhead transparencies, physical models), social configurations, and physical arrangements. Over a 4-month period, we collected data (video-taped activities, interviews, ethnographic observations, artifacts, and photographs) in a Grade 6-7 science class studying a unit on simple machines. Four different activity structures differed in terms of the social configuration (whole class, small group) and the origin of the central, activity-organizing artifact (teacher designed, student designed). This study describes how different artifacts, social configurations, and physical arrangements led to different interactional spaces, participant roles, and levels of participation in classroom conversations and, concomitantly, to different discursive forms and content. The artifacts had important functions in maintaining and sequencing conversations. Depending on the situation and the role of participants, artifacts served as resources for students' sense making. Each of the different activity structures supported different dimensions of participating in conversations and, for this reason, we conclude that science educators teaching large classes should employ a mixture of these activity structures.

466,The Emergence of 3D Geometry From Children's (Teacher-Guided) Classification Tasks,Roth & Thom,2009,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Geometry, classification, and the classification of geometrical objects are integral aspects of recent curriculum documents in mathematics education. Such curriculum documents, however, leave open how the work of classifying objects according to geometrical properties can be accomplished given that the knowledge of these properties is the planned outcome of the curriculum or lesson. The fundamental question of the present study therefore is this: How can a lesson in which children are asked to participate in a task of classifying regular 3-dimensional objects be a geometry lesson, given that the participating 2nd-grade children do not yet classify according to geometrical properties (predicates)? In our analyses, which are inspired by ethnomethodological studies of work, we focus on the embodied and collective work that leads to the emergence of the geometrical nature of this lesson. Thus, we report both the collective and the individual work by means of which the lesson outcomes—the complete classification of a set of “mystery” objects according to geometrical (shape) rather than other (color, size, “pointy-ness”) properties—are achieved. In the process, our study shows how geometrical work is reproduced by 2nd-grade children who, in a division of labor with their teachers, produce a particular set of geometrical practices (sorting three-dimensional objects according to their geometrical properties) for the 1st time.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400802581692,[theory] (Cultural-Historical) Activity Theory (CHAT); [theory] Embodied Cognition,[method] Ethnography; [method] Microgenetic Method; [method] participant observation,[pedagogy] Embodied Learning,,[setting] classrooms; [setting] elementary classrooms,,,[construct] spatial reasoning,"Embodied Cognition, Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT), Constructivist Theory,ethnography, classroom observation, microgenetic analysis,Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL), Guided Discovery,mathematics / geometry, elementary classrooms,emergence, classification, spatial reasoning, embodied learning, co-construction",[theory] (Cultural-Historical) Activity Theory (CHAT); [theory] Embodied Cognition; [method] Ethnography; [method] Microgenetic Method; [method] participant observation; [pedagogy] Embodied Learning; ; [setting] classrooms; [setting] elementary classrooms; ; ; [construct] spatial reasoning,,
467,"Learning in the Discovery Sciences: The History of a “Radical” Conceptual Change, or the Scientific Revolution That Was Not",Roth,2014,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"In this study, I provide a microgenetic-historical account of learning in an informal setting: the conceptual change that occurred while a university-based scientific research laboratory investigated the absorption of light in rod-based photoreceptors of coho salmon, which the “dogma” had suggested to be related to the migration between freshwater and saltwater environments. A morphogenetic, catastrophe theoretic model is proposed and used to structure the account of the conceptual change. The data derive from a 5-year video-based ethnographic study of the laboratory and the fish hatcheries that supplied it with hatchery-raised and wild coho at different developmental stages. Because the scientists collected their data over a 2-year period, slowing down the availability of what they would be saying were their complete data, opportunities arose for studying the conceptual change ethnographically. The study reports difficulties scientists encountered interpreting their data—because they (a) took a dogma-related perspective, (b) had to reconstruct and become familiar with the context from which they had abstracted their specimen, (c) required a biologically relevant rather than mathematically plausible explanation, and (d) exhibited aspect blindness that only disappeared as their familiarity increased.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2014.893435,[theory] (Cultural-Historical) Activity Theory (CHAT); [theory] Conceptual Change Theory; [theory] Epistemology,[method] conceptual modeling,,,,[subject] science,,[construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] epistemology; [construct] scientific reasoning,"Historical Epistemology, Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT), Conceptual Change Theory,historical analysis, theoretical synthesis,Inquiry Learning,science education, theoretical,conceptual change, history of science, knowledge evolution, epistemology, scientific reasoning",[theory] (Cultural-Historical) Activity Theory (CHAT); [theory] Conceptual Change Theory; [theory] Epistemology; [method] conceptual modeling; ; ; ; [subject] science; ; [construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] epistemology; [construct] scientific reasoning,,

As part of a larger team, we designed a curriculum that engaged 10 learners with 3 spatial tools: (a) an oversized floor map, (b) interactive geographic information systems (GIS) maps, and (c) participatory mapping. We analyze how these tools supported learning using notions of politicization. The floor map fed conceptual understandings of the map as a representational text and served as the terrain for an embodied activity to support proportional reasoning about inequitable distributions of resources. The data-rich GIS maps and their zoomability allowed for coordinating across multiple variables to connect patterns in inequities to other social processes. The participatory mapping enabled learners to make discoveries about, connect, and share beyond the individual classroom counterstories from people in the lived streets of their neighborhood.

This is particularly problematic in teacher education, as these misconceptions can be passed on by teachers to pupils at school. In this study, 40 preservice teachers studied 8 common misconceptions by 3 different approaches: learning by teaching (LbT) and learning from peers (LfP; both organized in cooperative groups and using self-developed activities) and conventional lecturing. Participants’ understanding was evaluated prior to, 1 month after, and 2 years after instruction, together with their views on the effectiveness of these methods for achieving learning. The 3 approaches improved scores on all posttests, but LbT achieved the best results. This coincided with perceptions of the participants who gave diverse reasons for the success of LbT. For lecturing, the longitudinal perspective showed that gains in student learning at 1 month had partially declined by 2 years, even though there was still a medium effect size compared to the pretest. However, for LbT and LfP gains remained statistically stable throughout. A combination of these methods might not only contribute efficiently to conceptual change for a good number of misconceptions but also connect teacher education to an almost real school classroom, giving opportunities to translate student learning into teaching practice.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2018.1506988,[theory] Social Constructivism,[method] Mixed Methods,[pedagogy] Cooperative Learning; [pedagogy] Peer Learning / Teaching,,,[subject] science,,[construct] collaboration; [construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] efficacy; [construct] reflection; [construct] self-efficacy,"Learning by Teaching Framework, Social Constructivism,longitudinal quasi-experiment, mixed methods,Peer Teaching, Cooperative Learning,science education, teacher preparation,teaching-to-learn, cooperation, conceptual change, reflection, self-efficacy",[theory] Social Constructivism; [method] Mixed Methods; [pedagogy] Cooperative Learning; [pedagogy] Peer Learning / Teaching; ; ; [subject] science; ; [construct] collaboration; [construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] efficacy; [construct] reflection; [construct] self-efficacy,,

We have developed two instructional approaches to improve collaboration in such settings by promoting people's capabilities to collaborate in a fruitful way and furthering their understanding of what characterizes good collaboration. The rationale is that strategies necessary for a good and effective computer-mediated collaboration may be conveyed to people by exposing them to an elaborated worked-out collaboration example (observational learning) or by giving them the opportunity to learn from scripted collaborative problem-solving. An experimental study was conducted that compared learning from observing a worked-out collaboration example with the learning effects of scripted collaborative problem-solving, the effects of unscripted collaborative problem-solving, and a control condition without a learning phase. The experimental design provided clearly separated phases for the instructional treatments (learning phase) and for applying and testing the acquired skills (application phase).

However, even in classrooms utilizing reform-based pedagogies, students are typically allowed to construct knowledge only insofar as they construct expected knowledge. In this report and reflection, we use activity theory to demonstrate how this pervasive tension between learning correct ideas and constructing one’s own ideas often results in unacknowledged slippage between competing activity systems within reform efforts. We use an analogy to the domain of spelling to introduce invented science—a framework for describing the activity of science learning that reduces this slippage by giving knowledge construction true priority over the canon. We describe the origins and purposes of invented spelling to theorize the nature of learning in invented science.

We propose that multimodal methods offer tools for observing emotion as a central facet of person–environment interaction and provide an example of these methods put into practice for a study of emotional engagement in mobile history learning. A multimodal analysis of video data from 16 pairs of 9- to 10-year-olds learning about the World War II history of their local Common is used to illustrate how students’ emotional engagement was supported by their use of mobile devices through multimodal layering and linking of stimuli, the creation of digital artifacts, and changes in pace.

His argument is a response to suggestions (CitationHofer & Pintrich, 1997; CitationSandoval, 2005) that the study of personal epistemology should focus on people's views about knowledge and knowing and not conflate those with views about learning. His main concern is that learners' views about knowledge and their views about learning may, in fact, be conflated and that an insistence on definitional clarity could lead to a mischaracterization of cognitive structures. In this response I argue that clarity in the definition of theoretical constructs does not imply exclusion of views about learning from the study of personal epistemology.

Analyses intended to disentangle conceptual and epistemic aspects of explanation reveal that groups sought plausible causal accounts of observed data, and were sensitive to the need for causal coherence, while articulating explanations consistent with the theory of natural selection. Groups often failed to explicitly cite data to support key claims, however, both because of difficulty in interpreting data and because they did not seem to see explicit evidence as crucial to an explanation.

Time constraints and the theory–practice divide are two well-documented concerns.

The course centers on systematic reflection and analysis of practice intended to foster career-long learning. We then examine the impact of this course on several facets of learning-from-teaching competencies, including teacher knowledge, beliefs, and practices. Sixty-two preservice teachers enrolled in a one-year post-bachelor elementary teacher preparation program were randomly assigned to attend this course or a more typical mathematics methods course. Findings: suggest that teacher preparation experiences centered on systematic reflection and analysis create opportunities to develop certain aspects of learning-from-teaching competencies that remain otherwise underdeveloped.

The authors used a grounded theory approach to identify how students’ racialized experiences help or hinder their historical analysis.FindingsThe findings suggest that students’ racialized experiences interplay with the disciplinary concepts of contextualization and presentism. Our findings complicate how disciplinary concepts alone do not sufficiently help students analyze how systemic racism manifests differently across historical moments.ContributionThis paper offers implications for how historical thinking skills can make space for students’ racialized and linguistic experiences.

We then zoomed in on one focal episode, in which emotions were leveraged for learning, demonstrating how narrated emotions may afford collaborative teacher inquiry.FindingsWe found that, in general, teachers tended to narrate and respond more to negative emotions than to positive ones. However, discussing students, they narrated more positive than negative emotions. Overall, the findings demonstrate the affordances of narrated emotions for teacher learning and the constraints imposed by the discourse emotional rules.ContributionWe suggest that frameworks for teacher learning should emphasize not only teacher pedagogical reasoning and action but also emotions, treating pedagogical emotions as objects for collaborative inquiry. Such frameworks should also consider the emotional rules that shape the PD discourse.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2025.2539845,[theory] Situative Perspective,[method] coding and categorization; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Narrative Inquiry; [method] qualitative coding,,,[setting] professional development; [setting] teacher professional development,,,[construct] affect; [construct] collaboration; [construct] emotion,",situative perspective,teacher education as collaboration,,,discourse analysis,qualitative coding,professional development meeting analysis,focal case study,,,,professional development,in-school PD teams,,,pedagogical emotions,emotion,collaboration,teacher discourse,emotion,narrative inquiry,",[theory] Situative Perspective; [method] coding and categorization; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Narrative Inquiry; [method] qualitative coding; ; ; [setting] professional development; [setting] teacher professional development; ; ; [construct] affect; [construct] collaboration; [construct] emotion,,
480,Teaching and Learning How to Create in Schools of Art and Design,Sawyer,2017,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article describes the studio model—a cultural model of teaching and learning found in U.S. professional schools of art and design. The studio model includes the pedagogical beliefs held by professors and the pedagogical practices they use to guide students in learning how to create. This cultural model emerged from an ethnographic study of two professional schools of art and design. A total of 38 professors from a total of 15 art disciplines and design disciplines were interviewed and their studio classes were observed. A grounded theory analysis was used to allow the studio model to emerge from audio recordings of interviews and video recordings of studio classes. The model was then validated by 16 different professors at six additional art and design schools. The studio model was found to be general across art and design disciplines and at all eight institutions. The central concept of the studio model is the creative process, with three clusters of emergent themes: learning outcomes associated with the creative process, project assignments that scaffold mastery of the creative process, and classroom practices that guide students through the creative process.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2017.1381963,,[method] Ethnography; [method] Qualitative Inquiry,[pedagogy] Studio-Based Learning,,,,,[construct] collaboration; [construct] creativity; [construct] expertise; [construct] reflection,"Creativity Theory, Sociocultural Theory of Learning, Improvisation Framework,ethnography, qualitative analysis,Studio-Based Learning, Creativity-Focused Instruction,art and design education, higher education studio classrooms,creativity, collaboration, improvisation, reflection, expertise",; [method] Ethnography; [method] Qualitative Inquiry; [pedagogy] Studio-Based Learning; ; ; ; ; [construct] collaboration; [construct] creativity; [construct] expertise; [construct] reflection,,

The first targets the children's emerging mathematical goals in collective practices, with a particular focus on the complex role that artifacts play in children's emerging goals. The second part focuses on children's developing mathematics that takes form in their goal-directed activities: (a) Microgenetic analyses concern the process whereby children structure cultural forms like artifacts to serve particular functions as they accomplish emerging mathematical goals; (b) sociogenetic analyses concern the spread or travel of mathematical forms and associated functions within a community of individuals; and (c) ontogenetic analyses concern the interplay between the forms that children use and the functions that they serve over the course of children's development.

Adult learners typically ask questions based on their perceived knowledge needs, whereas with school children, questions are typically asked by the teacher, based on the teacher's perception of the child's needs. Evidence shows that children can produce and recognize educationally productive questions and can adapt them to their knowledge needs. The challenge is to design environments in which students can use such questions to guide their building of knowledge, thus assuming a higher level of agency in learning.

These bases combine to support the following propositions: Schools need to be restructured as communities in which the construction of knowledge is supported as a collective goal, and the role of educational technology should be to replace classroom discourse patterns with those having more immediate and natural extensions to knowledge-building communities outside school walls. CSILE is described as a means for refraining classroom discourse to support knowledge building in ways extensible to out-of-school knowledgeadvancing enterprises.

We survey several of these methods of teaching and examine both their strengths and weaknesses. We then introduce six new teaching architectures, defined as a kind of general blueprint or framework that embodies a particular approach to teaching. We argue that using the power of the computer-based teaching medium, such teaching architectures can be designed to exploit the strengths of standard teaching methods while avoiding many of the pitfalls. Finally, we present a perspective on the role of computers in education, arguing that one of the main problems facing education today is students lack of control over the instruction they receive. As a first step in remedying this problem, we propose that educational software should provide students with a set of ""teaching buttons"" that will allow them to communicate easily with a computer-based teacher and thus more fully gain control over their interaction with the system.

The Goal-Based Scenario (GBS) framework describes computer-based learning environments that exploit this simple fact. In this article, we propose a structure and a set of design criteria for learn-by-doing environments that enable students to work towards desired goals. A key issue we address is the content to be taught by GBSs. Because skills are the form of knowledge that, when applied, enable students to achieve valued goals, we argue that GBSs should be designed to teach a set of target skills required to achieve a specified goal. Two programs we built prior to specifying GBSs but motivated by many of the same ideas will be analyzed according to the proposed principles.

The participants, 22 undergraduates with no formal college instruction in physics, worked individually on an initial problem to assess their conceptual models of circuits and in subsequent sessions on open-ended experimentation with the computer laboratory, attempted to rediscover the laws of electric circuits. Analysis of the initial problem identified four conceptual models in students' solutions. Lower level models were local, piecemeal, and represented the surface features of the materials, whereas higher level models were progressively more cohesive, integrated, and principled. Relationswere found between students' causal models and their learning gains in the computer laboratory. Good and poor learners with the laboratory were identified; these groups showed strategic differencesin goal-directedplanning, generating and interpreting evidence, and managing data. In general, sophisticatedmodels in the initial problem were related to sophisticated reasoning in the computer discovery task.

The activity included an instruction phase and a learner-led practice phase. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were used to examine learning differences across conditions.FindingsJoint visual attention correlated with learning gains during instruction and with instructors’ predictions of learner success in practice. Video analysis revealed three key affordances of SGVs: (1) tracking learners’ cognitive states, (2) using gaze as deictic gestures, and (3) providing just-in-time support.ContributionSGVs can enhance remote one-on-one teaching by compensating for missing nonverbal cues.

496,The Emergence of Abstract Representations in Dyad Problem Solving,Schwartz,1995,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Three experiments examined whether group cognitions generate a product that is not easily ascribed to the cognitions that similar individuals have working alone. In each study, secondary-school students solved novel problems working either as individuals or in two-person groups called dyads. An examination of their problem-solving representations demonstrated that the dyads constructed abstractions well above the rate one would expect given a ""most competent member"" model of group performance applied to the empirical rate of individual abstractions. In the first experiment, dyads induced a numerical parity rule for determining the motions of linked gears four times more often than individuals, who instead tended to rely exclusively on modeling the gears' physical behaviors. In a second experiment requiring the construction of visualizations on the topic of biological transmissions, dyads made abstract visualizations (e.g., directed graphs) significantly more often than individuals. In a third experiment requiring a visualization of organisms and their habitat requirements, dyads made abstract visualizations (e.g., matrices) five times more often than individuals, who instead tended to draw pictures. These results are striking because a long history of experimentation has found little evidence that group performances can match the performances of the most competent individuals, let alone exceed them. The extremely high frequency of abstract representations among dyads suggests that the abstract representations emerged from collaborative cognitions not normally available to isolated individuals. The results are interpreted to be a natural result of the collaborative task demand of creating a common ground. To facilitate discourse, dyads negotiated a common representation that could serve as a touchstone for coordinating the members' different perspectives on the problem. Because the representation bridged multiple perspectives of the problem structure, it tended...",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0403_3,[theory] Constructivism; [theory] Distributed Cognition,[method] Constructivism (Research Paradigm); [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [method] Microgenetic Method,[pedagogy] Collaborative Learning,,,,,[construct] collaboration; [construct] coordination; [construct] distributed cognition; [construct] representations,",distributed cognition,constructivism,representational learning,,,dyadic problem-solving analysis,microgenetic method,video analysis,,,,college-level physics,collaborative problem solving,,,abstraction,representation,coordination,learning through interaction,",[theory] Constructivism; [theory] Distributed Cognition; [method] Constructivism (Research Paradigm); [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [method] Microgenetic Method; [pedagogy] Collaborative Learning; ; ; ; ; [construct] collaboration; [construct] coordination; [construct] distributed cognition; [construct] representations,,

500,E-Moderation of Synchronous Discussions in Educational Settings: A Nascent Practice,Schwarz & Asterhan,2011,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"E-moderation has been a common practice in asynchronous discussions of postsecondary courses. We consider here e-moderation of synchronous discussions in the school context. We adopt a design research approach to elaborate an environment, the Argunaut system, that fits the reality of classrooms in which moderation of several small-group synchronous discussions in parallel is desirable. We describe the Argunaut system and then describe an experiment in which a moderator could elaborate several strategies in 2 synchronous discussions (1 with 2 groups in parallel and 1 with 4 groups in parallel).

501,Opportunities and hindrances for promoting interdisciplinary learning in schools,Schwarz et al.,2024,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Influential philosophers have suggested that interdisciplinarity is crucial for ecosystem management and scientific practice, and for education to democracy. However, a historical review of the rise of disciplines points at their compartmentalization in schools. An analysis of core construct categories of three disciplines, shows that this compartmentalization may decrease when dialogic argumentation is enacted. This background led us to launch an interdisciplinary program in schools. In previous publications, we identified multiple constraints in its implementation and listed design principles for affording interdisciplinary dialogic argumentation.MethodWe adopt a narrative approach to analyze classroom talk, and ask whether and how interdisciplinary processes emerge in this talk.FindingsStudents maintain dialogic argumentation around Interdisciplinary Social Dilemmas, but guidance is necessary for integrating knowledge from different disciplines. When the teacher is attentive to student’s unarticulated references to disciplinary ideas, she may subtly guide the emergence of interdisciplinary dialogic argumentation. Often, the teacher misses those opportunities and declaims the integration of knowledge in a non-dialogic talk.ContributionDialogic Education is crucial for the success of interdisciplinary programs in schools, but the actual emergence of interdisciplinary processes depends on the handling of organizational and institutional constraints, on huge design efforts, and on subtle guidance.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2024.2344809,[theory] Argumentation Theory,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Narrative Inquiry,[pedagogy] interdisciplinary learning,[population] middle school,,[subject] mathematics; [subject] philosophy education; [subject] science,,[construct] knowledge,",dialogic education,interdisciplinary learning,argumentation theory,,,narrative inquiry,classroom discourse analysis,,,,middle schools,interdisciplinary programs,mathematics,science education,philosophy education,,,dialogic argumentation,knowledge integration,design principles,institutional constraints,",[theory] Argumentation Theory; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Narrative Inquiry; [pedagogy] interdisciplinary learning; [population] middle school; ; [subject] mathematics; [subject] philosophy education; [subject] science; ; [construct] knowledge,,
499,Construction of Collective and Individual Knowledge in Argumentative Activity,Schwarz et al.,2003,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"In this article, we elaborate methodologies to study construction of knowledge in argumentative activities. For this purpose, we report on a quasi-empirical study on construction of knowledge through successive argumentative activities on a controversial issue. A group of 120 fifth grade students participated in successive argumentative activities; some activities involved individuals and some involved collectives. According to a first methodology, construction of knowledge was measured through arguments/outcomes produced. We developed tools for evaluating changes in individual and collective arguments. In the study, we showed the generally beneficial effect of argumentative activities on collective and individual arguments/outcomes. The significant discrepancies between collective and individual arguments suggested that individual students only partly internalized the collectively constructed arguments. We developed a qualitative methodology to refine this hypothesis as well as other hypotheses concerning the interpretation of the quantitative study. The integration of the quantitative and qualitative methodologies for studying argumentation helped identify several mechanisms of construction of knowledge in argumentative activities. In particular, it brought new light on the mediating role of representational tools such as Argumentative Maps or Pro-Con tables.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1202_3,[theory] Argumentation Theory; [theory] Distributed Cognition,[method] coding and categorization; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [method] qualitative coding,[pedagogy] Collaborative Learning,,,[subject] science,[technology] computer-supported learning,[construct] argumentation; [construct] collaboration; [construct] distributed cognition; [construct] participation,"Argumentation Theory, Distributed Cognition,discourse analysis, video analysis, qualitative coding,Collaborative Learning, Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL),science, secondary education, computer-supported learning,argumentation, collaboration, reasoning, participation",[theory] Argumentation Theory; [theory] Distributed Cognition; [method] coding and categorization; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [method] qualitative coding; [pedagogy] Collaborative Learning; ; ; [subject] science; [technology] computer-supported learning; [construct] argumentation; [construct] collaboration; [construct] distributed cognition; [construct] participation,,
502,Learning and constructions of us and them in teachers’ collaborative groups,Scott & Louie,2024,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Many studies have pointed to the importance of trust and inclusiveness in teachers’ collaborative groups. Here, we investigate how teachers negotiate dividing lines between “us” and “them” in moment-to-moment interaction. We also examine relationships between these negotiations, local arrangements, and teachers’ opportunities to learn.MethodsWe analyzed video recordings of two teacher groups, both oriented toward equitable mathematics instruction. We coordinated microinteractional analyses of four episodes with analyses of local arrangements that shaped interaction.FindingsIn both groups, participants worked to construct a sense of solidarity as “us.” Yet the threat of being positioned outside this “us”—as one of “them”—narrowed opportunities for teachers in both groups to engage in the vulnerable work of grappling with tensions and contradictions together. The salience of this threat was greater in one group than the other, however. We trace this to local arrangements that were differently designed, with different affordances for constructing “us” and “them.”ContributionThe social negotiation of exclusion and belonging in teacher groups is highly consequential for teacher learning. Better supporting teacher learning is not just a matter of remediating individuals’ skills or dispositions; it requires learning environments designed to support engagement with the tensions inherent in teaching..",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2024.2370003,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,

This study investigates how minoritized youth engage and make sense of newly developed COVID-19 vaccines and their intersections with the evolving multi-pandemic. Guided by theories of lively data, data sense and epistemic injustice, we center the experience of four Palestinian Arab minority youth in Israel context throughout the ongoing pandemic.MethodsOur analysis of long-form interviews and experience sampling was based on critical grounded theory. We also used counter-narrative to bring witness, capture youth first-hand experience, and recenter marginal knowledge.FindingsOur findings show how youth come to understand the multidimensional nature of the crisis through their first-hand sensory experiences with COVID-19 data.

We made video recordings of the lessons and interviewed the students and teachers. We observed eight focal silent students—four high-achieving and four low-achieving.FindingsParticipation patterns of high-achieving and low-achieving silent students diverge. High-achieving silent students are often called on by the teacher, and they give extended answers to difficult questions. Low-achieving silent students are called on rarely. High-achieving silent students use silence to consolidate their position as exceptionally capable students; low-achieving silent students use it to consolidate their position as less capable. However, it is possible to engage low-achieving silent students if the teacher notices their momentary spontaneous urge to participate and creates space for their voice in the classroom.ContributionThe paper focuses on the silent students who are often overlooked in studies on classroom talk.

The Content and Language Integrated Learning course was designed using a cognitive apprenticeship model and was based on principles likely to facilitate students’ written historical reasoning.Methods: Conducted as a quasi-experimental study, students in an experimental condition received explicit instruction in historical contextualization and other features of historical reasoning, while those in the control group participated in a version of the course without a focus on historical contextualization. Students’ historical reasoning was measured based on their argumentative document-based writing.Findings: Students’ in both the experimental and control groups significantly improved in all of the areas of historical reasoning that we measured. There was not a significant difference between the groups in the area of historical contextualization, but a further qualitative analysis demonstrated traces of the instructional approach in students’ writing. Unexpectedly, students in the experimental group were significantly better than the control group in terms of writing claims.

507,Learning to Deflect: Conceptual Change in Physics During Digital Game Play,Sengupta et al.,2015,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"How does deep conceptual change occur when students play well-designed educational games? To answer this question, we present a case study in the form of a microgenetic analysis of a student’s processes of knowledge construction as he played a conceptually-integrated digital game (SURGE Next) designed to support learning about Newtonian mechanics. Grounded in the Knowledge In Pieces framework of conceptual change (A. diSessa, 1993), we analyze the processes through which the student, Jamal, developed an expert-like understanding of deflections, a phenomenon that has been previously identified as challenging to understand for novice physics learners. We also explore the key characteristics of SURGE Next supporting these conceptual change processes. Our analysis shows that Jamal’s learning involved iterative refinement of his conceptual understanding through distributed encoding (A. diSessa, 1993). That is, as Jamal advanced through the game levels in SURGE Next, he developed a progressively more distributed sense of mechanism (A. diSessa, 1993) and was able to identify and operationalize the roles of the direction and magnitude of an object’s initial (or previous) velocity in determining the velocity resulting from the application of a new impulse.

508,Why Engaging in Mathematical Practices May Explain Stronger Outcomes in Affect and Engagement: Comparing Student-Driven With Highly Guided Inquiry,Sengupta-Irving & Enyedy,2014,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article investigates why students reported liking a student-driven learning design better than a highly guided design despite equivalent gains in knowledge assessments in both conditions. We created two learning designs based on the distinction in the literature between student-driven and teacher-led approaches. One teacher assigned each of her two 5th-grade classes to one design (n = 52); both designs addressed the mathematical concepts for the same amount of time. Data were collected using written assessments, surveys, and video. Students in both classes improved equivalently on assessments. On surveys, students in the student-driven condition were significantly more positive about learning. Video was coded to examine why students were more positive in the student-driven design. This analysis showed students engaging more frequently with data in discussing strategies, questioning peers, and aligning outcomes with prior experiences. We trace the association between students’ positive responses to learning and richer engagement in mathematical practices to specific features of the student-driven design. Furthermore, we reject competing explanations (e.g., amount of off-task behavior or adult intervention). We conclude that designing learning opportunities that promote mathematical practices affords opportunities to cultivate students’ disciplinary interest. We discuss implications for teachers and curriculum designers who are responding to new mathematics standards.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2014.928214,[theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] comparative analysis; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA),,,,[subject] mathematics,,[construct] affect; [construct] engagement; [construct] motivation; [construct] participation,"Practice-Based Learning, Sociocultural Theory, Identity Framework,comparative study, discourse analysis,Practice-Oriented Mathematics Instruction,mathematics education, middle school classrooms,engagement, affect, participation, disciplinary practices, motivation",[theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] comparative analysis; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); ; ; ; [subject] mathematics; ; [construct] affect; [construct] engagement; [construct] motivation; [construct] participation,,
509,Prolepsis & telos: Interpreting pedagogy and recovering imagination in the mediation of youth learning,Sengupta-Irving et al.,2022,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Makerspaces are proliferating U.S. public schools and libraries. Few studies, however, take an in situ view on the pedagogical moves of mentors, and fewer still engage with ideologies of race and class therein. Without this, principles of pedagogy or design that build toward expansive learning for racially minoritized youth will remain elusive.MethodsSemi-structured interviews and fieldnotes of mentors in a U.S. public library makerspace were taken over six weeks (n = 12). The mentors were predominantly white and all were professional artists/creatives; teen patrons were predominantly racially minoritized.FindingsThree recurring pedagogical moves surfaced through the interplay of prolepsis and telos as an interpretive lens.

510,Tracing the Evolution of Pedagogical Content Knowledge as the Development of Interanimated Discourses,Seymour & Lehrer,2006,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"For this article, the development of 1 teacher's pedagogical content knowledge (Shulman, 1986) was tracked longitudinally across 2 years as she taught a new instructional unit in middle school mathematics. Growth in pedagogical content knowledge is characterized as the interanimation of 2 Discourses (Gee, 1999). One Discourse refers to characteristic ways that students talk and act about the mathematics of the unit; and the other Discourse, to characteristic ways that the teacher talks and acts as she guides the development of students' mathematical thinking. At the inception of the unit, the variety of small d discourses students and teacher generated were only loosely coupled. Initially, the teacher responded to variations in student talk and activity by employing general revoicing heuristics, such as repeating what a student had said so that others could hear or by asking a question to elicit further elaboration of a particular student's pattern of thought. As the teacher attempted to orchestrate classroom conversations oriented toward developing mathematical understanding, these general heuristics often failed to transform student thinking in ways that she considered mathematically productive. As a consequence, she generated new conversational gambits that were more often tuned to particular elements of students' mathematical talk and activity. Some of these forms of talk created more fruitful classroom discourse about mathematics, which the teacher increasingly recognized as signals of particular ways of thinking about the mathematics (of slope). The teacher was not content with mere recognition. She elaborated and continued to innovate. Conjectures about the growth of pedagogical content knowledge were tested in video-stimulated structured interviews with the teacher and by modeling the syntax of teacher support of student thinking—predicting specific patterns of couplings between student and teacher Discourses. This article concludes with a discussion of the implications of this view for the ontogenesis of adaptive expertise.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls1504_5,[theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [method] longitudinal study,,,[setting] elementary classrooms,[subject] science,,[construct] discourse; [construct] reflection,"Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK), Sociocultural Theory, Discourse Theory,longitudinal case study, video analysis, discourse analysis,Inquiry-Based Science Education (IBSE),science education, elementary classrooms,pedagogical reasoning, discourse, reflection, teacher learning",[theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [method] longitudinal study; ; ; [setting] elementary classrooms; [subject] science; ; [construct] discourse; [construct] reflection,,

Within this framework, 1 of the aims of mathematical learning is to become skillful in the discursive use of designated symbolic artifacts supposed to mediate solving certain types of problems. My analysis of the learning episodes is aimed at uncovering the ways in which the discursive uses of such new symbolic tools were interactively constructed by the students. I argue that the construction process is extremely complex because of a certain inherent circularity of this process. The analysis reveals that this difficulty may be overcome by the gradual dialectic adjustment of former discursive habits to new contexts. The adjustment happens gradually, through cycles of intimations about the applicability of the old habits followed by implementations in which this applicability is examined. This intricate interplay of intimations and implementations is found in both the Batteries and the AIDS episodes and is presented in detail in the article.

513,"When the Rules of Discourse Change, but Nobody Tells You: Making Sense of Mathematics Learning From a Commognitive Standpoint",Sfard,2007,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The interpretive framework for the study of learning introduced in this article and called commognitive is grounded in the assumption that thinking is a form of communication and that learning mathematics is tantamount to modifying and extending one's discourse. These basic tenets lead to the conclusion that substantial discursive change, rather than being necessitated by an extradiscursive reality, is spurred by commognitive conflict, that is, by the situation that arises whenever different interlocutors are acting according to differing discursive rules. The framework is applied in 2 studies, one of them featuring a class learning about negative numbers and the other focusing on 2 first graders learning about triangles and quadrilaterals. In both cases, the analysis of data is guided by questions about (a) features of the new mathematical discourse that set it apart from the mathematical discourse in which the students were conversant when the learning began; (b) students' and teachers' efforts toward the necessary discursive transformation; and (c) effects of the learning–teaching process, that is, the extent of discursive change actually resulting from these efforts. One of the claims corroborated by the findings is that school learning requires an active lead of an experienced interlocutor and needs to be fueled by a learning-teaching agreement between the interlocutor and the learners.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400701525253,[theory] Commognitive Theory; [theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] conceptual modeling; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA),,,[setting] secondary education,[subject] mathematics,,[construct] communication; [construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] discourse; [construct] participation,"Commognitive Theory, Sociocultural Theory, Discourse Theory,theoretical synthesis, discourse analysis,Discourse-Based Mathematics Instruction,mathematics education, secondary classrooms,communication, discourse, participation, meaning, conceptual change",[theory] Commognitive Theory; [theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] conceptual modeling; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); ; ; [setting] secondary education; [subject] mathematics; ; [construct] communication; [construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] discourse; [construct] participation,,

514,The Relevance of Hierarchies to Learning Biology From Hypertext,Shapiro,1999,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Previous research on text-based learning has shown the relevance of hierarchical structures to the acquisition of complex concepts and the formation of knowledge structures. Because of the inflexible nature of traditional text, however, these studies have been limited to comparing participants learning with either hierarchical or linear presentations. As a consequence, our understanding of the importance of hierarchies to information processing is only relative to that of linear text. The purpose of this investigation is to move beyond that comparison, to explore more deeply the relevance of hierarchies to information processing. For this study, the traits that characterize a hierarchy were isolated and used in varying combinations to create 4 different organizations for a single body of information: hierarchical, clustered, unstructured, and linear. The creation of these structures was made possible by hypertext technology. Participants were each assigned to study one of these systems and were then asked to take cued-association, problem-solving, and factual-knowledge posttests. Results of these tests suggest that participants in all conditions created hierarchical representations as they worked and that those in the nonlinear conditions used this structure to guide their exploration of the material. They also suggest that an important function of hierarchies may be to define relations between concepts. Results are discussed in relation to current theories of learning, the construction of knowledge structures, and application to educational settings.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0802_2,[theory] Cognitive Theory; [theory] Schema Theory,[method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] experimental design,,,[setting] higher education,[subject] biology,[technology] computer-based instruction; [technology] hypermedia,[construct] conceptual understanding,",cognitive theory,hypertext learning,schema theory,,,experimental study,design-based analysis,,,,higher education,biology education,computer-based learning,,,hypertext systems,hierarchical structure,navigation,conceptual understanding,learning strategies,",[theory] Cognitive Theory; [theory] Schema Theory; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] experimental design; ; ; [setting] higher education; [subject] biology; [technology] computer-based instruction; [technology] hypermedia; [construct] conceptual understanding,,

Transcript Explorer frames video as playscript-like records, offering ways to dynamically explore transcripts of multimodal interaction linked to video. The Interaction Geography Slicer frames video through the lens of movement, providing an approach to dynamically visualize interaction over geographic space and time. The Pointillizer frames images in video to characterize material and affective dimensions of a scene.ContributionWe illustrate how these tools embody distinct epistemological commitments and foster new researcher-data-relationships that enliven the analysis and experience of teaching and learning.

We report the design of the nQuire toolkit, a system to support scripted personal inquiry learning, and a study of its use with school students ages 11–14. This differs from previous work on inquiry learning by its emphasis on learners investigating topics of personal significance supported by a computer-based toolkit to guide school pupils through an entire inquiry process that connects structured learning in the classroom with discovery and data collection at home or outdoors. Findings: from the studies indicate that the toolkit was successfully adopted by teachers and pupils in contexts that included teacher-directed lessons, an after-school club, field trips, and learner-managed homework. It effectively supported the transition between individual, group, and whole-class activities and supported learning across formal and informal settings. We discuss issues raised by the intervention studies, including how the combination of technology and pedagogy provided support for the teacher despite difficulties in managing the technology and integrating field data into a classroom lesson. We also discuss the difficulty of altering young people’s attitudes to science.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2014.944642,[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR),[method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Mixed Methods,[pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL),,,[subject] science,[technology] mobile devices,[construct] agency; [construct] collaboration,"Inquiry-Based Learning, Mobile Learning Framework, Orchestration Theory,design-based research, mixed methods,Inquiry-Based Science Learning, Technology-Enhanced Learning,science education, formal–informal hybrid learning environments,inquiry, orchestration, mobile learning, collaboration, student agency",[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Mixed Methods; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL); ; ; [subject] science; [technology] mobile devices; [construct] agency; [construct] collaboration,,

Building on race critical code studies and identity-as-narrative theories, we examine restorying through Black womanist storytelling methodologies for integrating Black girls’ intersectional identities when designing and reimagining their computing futures. We ask: How might womanist storytelling methods support one Black girl in restorying possible computing futures?MethodsWe present a case focused on one study participant, Heather’s, restorying practices situated within a larger workshop wherein marginalized youth reimagined dominant narratives about computer science (CS). This was by creating interactive quilt patches using paper circuits and microcontrollers that challenged dominant narratives of white masculinity and misogynoir normalized throughout the field.FindingsWe see that restorying through womanist storytelling methods allowed Heather to (1) deconstruct narratives of white masculinity and misogynoir throughout CS education by centering Black women’s ways of knowing and doing, and (2) restory the past to enact possible CS futures and identities through computing.ContributionIn the discussion, we address challenges and successes with integrating Black girls’ experiences with speculative methodologies in learning sciences research.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2023.2179847,[theory] Critical Race Theory; [theory] Womanist Theory,[method] Narrative Inquiry; [method] Womanist Methodology,,[population] black girlhood; [population] youth,,[subject] literacy,,[construct] identity; [construct] narrative,",womanist theory,critical race feminism,narrative inquiry,,,womanist storytelling,narrative inquiry,counter-storytelling,,,,youth,Black girlhood,literacy education,afterschool program,,,storytelling,identity,resistance,racialized gender,speculative imagination,future-making,",[theory] Critical Race Theory; [theory] Womanist Theory; [method] Narrative Inquiry; [method] Womanist Methodology; ; [population] black girlhood; [population] youth; ; [subject] literacy; ; [construct] identity; [construct] narrative,,

520,From Theory to Data: The Process of Refining Learning Progressions,Shea & Duncan,2013,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Learning progressions (LPs) are theoretical models of how learners develop expertise in a domain over extended periods of time. Recent policy reports have touted LPs as a promising approach to aligning standards, curriculum, and assessment. However, the scholarship on LPs is relatively sparse, and the jury is still out on the theoretical and practical value of this approach. To realize any potential of LPs researchers need to systematically refine these hypothetical models in real-world contexts. Such refinement efforts are challenging, as they require the coordination of messy empirical data with often underspecified theoretical models. Many of the current reports involving the empirical refinement and validation of LPs do not sufficiently explicate the process of how one goes about making modifications to the LP based on empirical data. In this article we present heuristics for facilitating the coordination of data and LP models. Using an illustrative example of a genetics LP and data from a 2-year longitudinal study of this LP, we demonstrate the use of these heuristics to refine the hypothesized levels of the LP. We also discuss the process we used to identify contingencies (relationships) between the constructs of this LP. We conclude with a discussion of implications of the refinement process for the alignment of curriculum, instruction, and assessment.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2012.691924,[theory] Epistemic Cognition; [theory] Learning Progressions Framework,[method] Mixed Methods,,,[setting] K–12 education,[subject] science,,[construct] epistemic cognition,"Learning Progressions Framework, Cognitive Development Theory, Epistemic Cognition,mixed methods, learning progression analysis,Conceptual Learning,science education, K–12 classrooms,conceptual progression, theory refinement, alignment, evidence-based design",[theory] Epistemic Cognition; [theory] Learning Progressions Framework; [method] Mixed Methods; ; ; [setting] K–12 education; [subject] science; ; [construct] epistemic cognition,,

Although researchers studying commonsense science have employed a variety of methods, 1-on-1 clinical interviews have played a unique role. The data that result from these interviews take the form of video recordings, which in turn are often compiled into written transcripts and coded by human analysts. In this article, I explore the application of computational techniques to the analysis of this familiar type of data. I describe the success I have had using extremely simple methods from computational linguistics—methods that are based on rudimentary vector space models and simple clustering algorithms. These automated analyses are employed in an exploratory mode as a way to discover student conceptions in the data. The aims of this article are primarily methodological in nature: I attempt to show that it is possible to use techniques from computational linguistics to analyze data from commonsense science interviews in a manner that may provide convergent support for the work of human analysts.

Studies in this field offer conflicting views on children’s mechanistic reasoning, with some suggesting that children tend to use other non-mechanistic types of reasoning.MethodsWe used a mixed methods exploratory research design to investigate the evaluation and construction of explanations by children in grades 2–6. Children were asked to construct explanations for a biological phenomenon and to evaluate mechanistic and non-mechanistic explanations for three other biological phenomena.FindingsChildren who participated in this study could construct mechanistic explanations, even 2nd graders. Moreover, they accepted more mechanistic explanations than non-mechanistic ones and preferred them over others. Two epistemic criteria seem to contribute to this evaluation process: “explanatory power” assists the children in differentiating between mechanistic and non-mechanistic explanations, and “information accuracy” leads them to reject explanations that contradict their prior knowledge. We found that the accuracy criterion is grounded in knowledge of biology and thinking tools such as thinking across levels.ContributionOur results highlight the epistemic perspective that elementary school children adopt when evaluating mechanistic and non-mechanistic explanations of biological phenomena and their emerging potential for mechanistic reasoning.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2024.2432682,[theory] Epistemic Cognition,[method] Mixed Methods,,[population] elementary education,[setting] science classrooms,[subject] biology,,[construct] epistemic cognition; [construct] explanation,",mechanistic reasoning,epistemic criteria,,,mixed methods,exploratory design,explanation construction,explanation evaluation,,,,elementary education,biology education,science classrooms,,,mechanistic explanation,explanatory power,information accuracy,epistemic cognition,",[theory] Epistemic Cognition; [method] Mixed Methods; ; [population] elementary education; [setting] science classrooms; [subject] biology; ; [construct] epistemic cognition; [construct] explanation,,
524,Individual Differences in Patterns of Spontaneous Online Tool Use,Shute & Gluck,1996,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"More than 400 individuals participated in an experiment involving two versions of a computer-based tutor teaching principles of electricity. We examined the relations among elective tool use, learning environment, outcome, and efficiency. We also tested the influence of both individual differences and learning environment on tool-usage behavior. The data showed no differences between the two learning environments (rule application vs. rule induction) with regard to outcome performance or learning efficiency. In addition, neither environment significantly influenced overall tool use. There was a main effect of tool use on learning outcome, but not on learning time. We categorized learners into four groups, based on tool-usage patterns and found that (a) people tended to show stable patterns across time and (b) that patterns differed significantly in terms of learning outcome—it was most effective to use the online tools earlier in the learning process rather than later. In terms of individual differences, we identified the characteristics of learners who evidenced different tool-usage patterns. They varied according to cognitive ability, domain-related interest, and gender. We propose a causal model that takes into account all of these data sources in predicting posttest performance.

Within PS-I, no research has examined how moment-by-moment determinants of affective states impact the problem-solving phase and posttest performance.MethodsI develop a multimodal learning analytics pipeline to (a) infer affective states in PS-I via observable facial movements, (b) understand how the incidence and temporal dynamics of these states vary based on manipulating the problem-solving context with scaffolding strategies (failure-driven, success-driven, none) in an experimental study (N = 132), and (c) assess the extent to which affective states might explain learning.FindingsStudents exposed to failure-driven scaffolding show exclusive dynamics comprising shame, a self-conscious emotion associated with metacognitive and cognitive benefits. Failure-driven scaffolding also creates opportunities for relatively greater emotional displays of knowledge emotions (e.g., surprise, interest). Hostile emotions differentially impact learning in PS-I, with the incidence of anger and disgust showing positive associations and the incidence of contempt showing a negative association.

Online social media platforms have enabled the creation of distributed studio networks (DSNs) that link studio-based learning environments into expanded communities of practice and potential networked improvement communities. As learning scientists, we do not adequately understand how to infrastructure learning and resource sharing across distributed studios. In this ethnography of the infrastructure of Design for America, a DSN, we analyzed data from interviews, online communication, and field observations as the organization grew its network of university design studios. We found that Design for America managers faced challenges of providing support and resources to address wide variation in needs across studios. Lacking an existing comprehensive network collaboration platform, managers created a proto-infrastructure to distribute support across studios. By studying their iterative adoption of communication and collaboration tools and organizational routines, we define a unique set of design principles to infrastructure DSNs: (a) surfacing local progress and problems, (b) affective crowding, (c) solution mapping, and (d) help routing. Assembling constellations of tools and designing platforms based on these principles could support learning in and the improvement of DSNs across domains.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2017.1409119,[theory] Distributed Cognition; [theory] Networked Learning; [theory] Sociomaterial Theory,[method] Case Study Research; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR),[pedagogy] Networked Learning,,,,,[construct] collaboration; [construct] distributed cognition,"Infrastructuring Framework, Distributed Cognition, Sociomaterial Theory,case study, design-based analysis,Collaborative Studio Learning, Networked Learning,design education, distributed studio environments,infrastructure, collaboration, distributed systems, design principles, technology mediation",[theory] Distributed Cognition; [theory] Networked Learning; [theory] Sociomaterial Theory; [method] Case Study Research; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Networked Learning; ; ; ; ; [construct] collaboration; [construct] distributed cognition,,

Conceptual Bootstrapping With Stripped-Down Visual Analogs,Smith & Unger,1997,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This study explores student ability to differentiate and make mappings between quantities in different domains before and after a relevant curricular experience. Twenty 7th-grade students were given pre- and postinterviews that probed their understanding of 3 intensive and extensive quantity pairs (dot crowdedness and total dots; sweetness and total sugar; density and total weight) and their ability to use the former quantities to model the quantities of the latter two domains. The 2-week curriculum intervention focused on using an integrated dots-per-box model to represent various everyday quantities like sweetness of Kool-Aid. Prior to instruction there were disparities in student understanding of the 3 domains, and few students could make relevant mappings between the quantities in the model and the domains of sweetness and density. Instruction led to improvement in student differentiation and modeling of sweetness, a quantity directly considered in instruction. There was no change in student differentiation of density, a quantity not considered in instruction, although some students improved in their modeling of density. These findings are interpreted as showing that conceptual bootstrapping involves a multistepped mapping process that is facilitated through classroom dialogue, problem solving, and instruction.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0602_1,[theory] Cognitive Development; [theory] Cognitive Theory; [theory] Conceptual Change Theory,[method] experimental design,,,,,[technology] visualization tools,[construct] conceptual understanding,",conceptual bootstrapping,analogical reasoning,cognitive theory,,,experimental study,visual representation tasks,,,,undergraduate psychology,learning from representations,,,abstraction,visual analogy,representation mapping,conceptual development,",[theory] Cognitive Development; [theory] Cognitive Theory; [theory] Conceptual Change Theory; [method] experimental design; ; ; ; ; [technology] visualization tools; [construct] conceptual understanding,,

532,Misconceptions Reconceived: A Constructivist Analysis of Knowledge in Transition,Smith III et al.,1994,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article uses a critical evaluation of research on student misconceptions in science and mathematics to articulate a constructivist view of learning in which student conceptions play productive roles in the acquisition of expertise. We acknowledge and build on the empirical results of misconceptions research but question accompanying views of the character, origins, and growth of students' conceptions. Students have often been viewed as holding flawed ideas that are strongly held, that interfere with learning, and that instruction must confront and replace. We argue that this view overemphasizes the discontinuity between students and expert scientists and mathematicians, making the acquisition of expertise difficult to conceptualize. It also conflicts with the basic premise of constructivism: that students build more advanced knowledge from prior understandings. Using case analyses, we dispute some commonly cited dimensions of discontinuity and identify important continuities that were previously ignored or underemphasized. We highlight elements of knowledge that serve both novices and experts, albeit in different contexts and under different conditions. We provide an initial sketch of a constructivist theory of learning that interprets students' prior conceptions as resources for cognitive growth within a complex systems view of knowledge. This theoretical perspective aims to characterize the interrelationships among diverse knowledge elements rather than identify particular flawed conceptions; it emphasizes knowledge refinement and reorganization, rather than replacement, as primary metaphors for learning; and it provides a framework for understanding misconceptions as both flawed and productive.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0302_1,[theory] Conceptual Ecology; [theory] Constructivism; [theory] Knowledge in Pieces,[method] Case Study Research; [method] coding and categorization; [method] Constructivism (Research Paradigm); [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] qualitative coding,,,,[subject] science,,[construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] learning processes,",constructivism,knowledge-in-pieces,conceptual change,,,case study,discourse analysis,qualitative coding,,,,science education,middle school classrooms,,,knowledge transition,naive conceptions,conceptual ecology,learning processes,",[theory] Conceptual Ecology; [theory] Constructivism; [theory] Knowledge in Pieces; [method] Case Study Research; [method] coding and categorization; [method] Constructivism (Research Paradigm); [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] qualitative coding; ; ; ; [subject] science; ; [construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] learning processes,,
533,Conceptual Change and Wine Expertise,Solomon,1997,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Two studies explore conceptual change in the acquisition of wine expertise. In Experiment 1, tasters described a set of wines. Experts described the wines using more specific features than did intermediates, who, in turn, used more specific features than did novices. Specificity in describing wines was not related to discrimination performance on a psychophysical test. A regression analysis indicated that the features identified by the expert as well as those identified by the nonexpert tasters covaried with grape type, such that wines of the same grape were described more similarly than were wines of different grapes. In Experiment 2, the same tasters sorted the wines into clusters. Experts, unlike nonexperts, tended to sort the wines explicitly by grape type. Moreover, the features of the wines (described by the tasters in Experiment 1) covaried significantly better by the experts' clusters than they did by the nonexperts' clusters. Indeed, the features identified by the nonexperts covaried significantly worse when the wines were clustered by their own sortings than they did when the wines were clustered by actual grape type. It is suggested that the acquisition of wine expertise, a domain that is at once conceptual and perceptual, entails not only a greater differentiation of features but also a restructuring of the explicit schemes of classification.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0601_3,[theory] Cognitive Psychology,[method] Case Study Research,,,,,,[construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] domain knowledge; [construct] perception,",conceptual change,expertise development,cognitive psychology,,,case study,knowledge structure analysis,,,,wine expertise,sensory training,,,expert-novice comparison,domain knowledge,conceptual restructuring,perception,",[theory] Cognitive Psychology; [method] Case Study Research; ; ; ; ; ; [construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] domain knowledge; [construct] perception,,

By ignoring issues of body, ethnicity and culture, these framings limit access to physics for many, including Black girls, who struggle to gain access to physics. Studying the situated, embodied cultural practices of Black girls in physics learning environments provides a window into the range of resources available for physics exploration and illuminates possibilities for culturally relevant physics pedagogies. We engaged in micro-ethnographic analysis of video of youth actions and interactions during collaborative activities that combined dance and dance-making practices with physics content. Our findings show how (1) dance offered an embodied lens for physics investigation; (2) positioning movement as inquiry gave dancers access to an expanded vocabulary for sense-making; and (3) dance provided opportunities to bring in social and cultural resources as critical funds of knowledge. This article expands the view of funds of knowledge by reintroducing the body, movement, and embodied interaction as resources for learning and engagement and offers an expanded view of physics sense-making that includes cultural embodied resources and foregrounds Black girls, whose voices and experiences are often left out of learning research.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2021.2023543,,,,,,,,,",,,,",; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,

A Document Analysis of 75 Graduate Programs,Sommerhoff et al.,2018,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The learning sciences, as an academic community investigating human learning, emerged more than 30 years ago. Since then, graduate learning sciences programs have been established worldwide. Little is currently known, however, about their disciplinary backgrounds and the topics and research methods they address. In this document analysis of the websites of 75 international graduate learning sciences programs, we examine central concepts and research methods across institutions, compare the programs, and assess the homogeneity of different subgroups. Results reveal that the concepts addressed most frequently were real-world learning in formal and informal contexts, designing learning environments, cognition and metacognition, and using technology to support learning. Among research methods, design-based research (DBR), discourse and dialog analyses, and basic statistics stand out. Results show substantial differences between programs, yet programs focusing on DBR show the greatest similarity regarding the other concepts and methods they teach. Interpreting the similarity of the graduate programs using a community of practice perspective, there is a set of relatively coherent programs at the core of the learning sciences, pointing to the emergence of a discipline, and a variety of multidisciplinary and more heterogeneous programs “orbiting” the core in the periphery, shaping and innovating the field.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2018.1440353,[theory] Epistemology,[method] content analysis; [method] Curriculum Design Research,,,,,,[construct] epistemology,"Meta-Research Framework, Curriculum Studies Framework,document analysis, content analysis,Learning Sciences Education, Graduate Instruction,learning sciences education, graduate programs,disciplinary scope, methods training, epistemology, curriculum design",[theory] Epistemology; [method] content analysis; [method] Curriculum Design Research; ; ; ; ; ; [construct] epistemology,,
536,Exploring Learning Opportunities in Coordinated Network-Enhanced Classrooms: A Case of Kids as Global Scientists,Songer,1996,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"With the careful examination of one Internet-infused learning environment, this article begins a dialogue on the new potentials for learning that exist when students use the best features of the Internet telecommunications network to conduct genuine questioning and investigation in middle school science classrooms. Learning features explored include communication and the value of quick access to a wide range of information and resources. To best utilize these features, new instructional models are developed including the design of a coordinated, distributed-learning approach to guide the development of cohesive and relevant understandings. Learning potentials are explored and continued challenges, primarily in facilitating the learning, are discussed. Potential changes discussed include role changes for project participants, including the addition of new participants and the shift in roles for continued participants; the potential for more personal, intermediate-level explanations of science phenomena; and new opportunities for increased motivation to learn.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0504_1,[theory] Constructivism; [theory] Networked Learning,[method] Case Study Research; [method] Constructivism (Research Paradigm),[pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL); [pedagogy] Networked Learning,[population] middle school,,[subject] science,[technology] online forums,,",inquiry-based learning,networked learning,constructivism,,,case study,technology-enhanced learning analysis,,,,middle school,science education,online collaboration,,,global science projects,data sharing,authentic inquiry,technology integration,",[theory] Constructivism; [theory] Networked Learning; [method] Case Study Research; [method] Constructivism (Research Paradigm); [pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL); [pedagogy] Networked Learning; [population] middle school; ; [subject] science; [technology] online forums; ,,
537,Developing Symbolic Interpretation Through Literary Argumentation,Sosa et al.,2015,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Literature can be a powerful resource for adolescents’ psychosocial development, as it provides opportunities to experience the world through the perspectives of others and juxtapose these with one’s own experiences. However, gaining access to these perspectives requires going beyond literal words on the page to explore interpretive meanings. This mixed-methods case study addresses the need to better understand how adolescent students learn to interpret literary works. Specifically, 9th-grade students participated in a 5-week instructional module focused on symbolic interpretation and coming of age themes in texts with a variety of sources of complexity. The primary data sources were an intentional sample of classroom discussions and essays written before and after instruction. Analyses indicate that students learned to make interpretive claims around symbolism. Textual evidence to support these claims was evident in whole-class discussions but less so in the written essays. Students also struggled to reason about why evidence supported particular claims and how the interpretive claims were related to understanding the characters and their worlds. Discussion focuses on the value of symbolic interpretation as a starting point for engaging adolescents in interpretive practices but notes that developing facility with literary interpretation takes concerted effort over longer periods of time.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2015.1124040,[theory] Argumentation Theory; [theory] Social-Cognitive Theory,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] participant observation,,,[setting] classrooms,,,[construct] argumentation; [construct] collaboration; [construct] metacognition,"Sociocognitive Theory, Argumentation Framework, Discourse Analysis Theory,discourse analysis, classroom observation,Argumentation-Based Learning, Dialogic Literacy,language arts education, high school English classrooms,argumentation, symbolism, interpretation, metacognition, collaboration",[theory] Argumentation Theory; [theory] Social-Cognitive Theory; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] participant observation; ; ; [setting] classrooms; ; ; [construct] argumentation; [construct] collaboration; [construct] metacognition,,

This article articulates the pedagogical potential of augmented reality simulations in environmental engineering education by immersing students in the roles of scientists conducting investigations. This design experiment examined if augmented reality simulation games can be used to help students understand science as a social practice, whereby inquiry is a process of balancing and managing resources, combining multiple data sources, and forming and revising hypotheses in situ. We provide 4 case studies of secondary environmental science students participating in the program. Positioning students in virtual investigations made apparent their beliefs about science and confronted simplistic beliefs about the nature of science. Playing the game in “real” space also triggered students' preexisting knowledge, suggesting that a powerful potential of augmented reality simulation games can be in their ability to connect academic content and practices with students' physical, lived worlds. The game structure provided students a narrative to think with, although students differed in their ability to create a coherent narrative of events. We argue that Environmental Detectives is 1 model for helping students understand the socially situated nature of scientific practice.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400701413435,[theory] Constructionism; [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Situated Learning,[method] Design-Based Research (DBR),[pedagogy] Constructionism; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL),,[setting] out-of-school programs,,[technology] augmented reality; [technology] games,[construct] collaboration; [construct] engagement; [construct] motivation,"Situated Learning, Constructionism, Game-Based Learning,design-based research, field study,Augmented Reality Learning, Inquiry-Based Learning,science and social studies, middle school classrooms, augmented reality, handheld devices,engagement, collaboration, immersion, context, motivation",[theory] Constructionism; [theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Situated Learning; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Constructionism; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL); ; [setting] out-of-school programs; ; [technology] augmented reality; [technology] games; [construct] collaboration; [construct] engagement; [construct] motivation,,

In both settings, participants used both computer and paper-based media in architectural project work. This study found that, in both settings, collaborative labor was divided between designers who worked on paper and draftspersons who worked with computers. The analysis compares the origins of these divisions of labor and finds important similarities in the reasons for the divisions of labor and important differences in the implications of the divisions of labor for participants.

The study contributes to theoretical understandings of critical data literacies by considering the experiences and practices of adolescents enrolled in a required media arts class as they produced data visualizations drawn from their everyday lives. Findings: center on two aspects of critical data literacies youth developed—understanding themselves as people capable of using data for multiple purposes and understanding data as socially situated resources for meaning-making. This study foregrounds the importance of positioning youth as authors and architects of data, making central youth perspectives in understanding the role of data in young people’s digitally connected lives and highlighting the importance of expanding what “counts” as data.

However, curated sites of learning can also uphold ways of knowing that can cause harm to people marginalized from knowledge production, which philosophers describe as epistemic injustice. By looking across fields of research (education and philosophy), I describe how epistemic injustice can be utilized in education research to provide a shared analytical lens for examining curated sites of learning. I name four levels of interaction in which epistemic injustice can occur given their purposeful design by people with power: moment-to-moment interactions, micro (within a site), meso (between local sites) and macro (between sites and national/international policies and rhetoric). I describe how educators and researchers might disrupt epistemic injustice through the examination of curated learning sites and their personal ideas about knowledge.

543,Applying the PAIR-C Framework to foster deep understanding and address misconceptions in science education,Su et al.,2025,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Understanding complex scientific phenomena, such as natural selection, requires engaging with emergent patterns and causal mechanisms, which are often misunderstood due to persistent misconceptions. Traditional instruction may not adequately support conceptual change in this domain.MethodsThis study explores the integration of the PAIR-C (Pattern, Agents, Interactions, Relations, and Causality) Framework with agent-based models (ABMs) to enhance conceptual understanding of natural selection. Fifty undergraduate students participated online and were randomly assigned to two groups. One group received instruction that follows the PAIR-C framework, while the other was taught using traditional Darwinian principles, both employing ABM scenarios. Assessments included pre-posttests, video recordings, surveys, and interviews, with misconceptions analyzed through epistemic network analysis (ENA).FindingsThe PAIR-C approach significantly improves students’ deep understanding of natural selection, more effectively reducing misconceptions compared to the traditional method. Further, ENA revealed distinct characteristics of misconception between the groups, with the intervention group showing a more focused pattern compared to the control group. Video analysis also showed different types of interactions occurring during the PAIR-C modules.ContributionThis study demonstrates that the PAIR-C framework, when combined with ABMs, can foster deeper scientific understanding and conceptual change, with implications for broader application in complex systems education.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2025.2546471,[theory] Conceptual Change Theory; [theory] PAIR-C Framework,[method] quasi-experimental design; [method] surveys,,,[setting] chemistry classrooms,[subject] science,,[construct] understanding,",PAIR-C Framework,conceptual change theory,,,quasi-experimental design,surveys,classroom intervention,,,,science education,secondary education,chemistry classrooms,,,deep understanding,misconceptions,conceptual learning,instructional design,",[theory] Conceptual Change Theory; [theory] PAIR-C Framework; [method] quasi-experimental design; [method] surveys; ; ; [setting] chemistry classrooms; [subject] science; ; [construct] understanding,,

Here we develop and test a Vygotsky-derived hypothesis that postulates playful talk as a mechanism for identity exploration and group status negotiation. Our findings indicate that students utilized the playful talk genre as a means to (a) position themselves and others as more or less competent within the group in order to create or foreclose opportunities to learn, (b) maintain and strengthen bonds that were developing within the group toward the goal of achieving higher levels of coordination and opportunities to learn, and (c) pivot toward a self-selected identity aimed sometimes at affecting one’s status within the group. Taken together, these 3 playful talk functions allowed the group to manage tensions that arose as a result of periods of low coordination and to open opportunities to learn for lower status group members. This study contributes to researchers’ understanding of affective aspects of collaborative learning, which are theorized as foundational to success in such endeavors.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2013.839945,,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA),,,,[subject] STEM,,[construct] collaboration; [construct] creativity; [construct] discourse; [construct] play,"Sociocultural Learning Theory, Dialogic Learning Framework, Play Theory,discourse analysis, ethnographic study,Collaborative Play-Based Learning,STEM education, middle school group work,discourse, collaboration, play, creativity, co-construction",; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); ; ; ; [subject] STEM; ; [construct] collaboration; [construct] creativity; [construct] discourse; [construct] play,,
546,An Experimental Study of the Effects of Representational Guidance on Collaborative Learning Processes,Suthers & Hundhausen,2003,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The importance of both social processes and of representational aids for learning is well-established, yet few experimental studies have addressed the combination of these factors. The research reported in this article evaluates the influence of tools for constructing representations of evidential models on collaborative learning processes and outcomes. Pairs of participants worked with 1 of 3 representations (Graph, Matrix, Text) while investigating complex science and public health problems. Dependent measures included (a) the content of participants' utterances and representational actions and the timing of these utterances and actions with respect to the availability of information; (b) a multiple choice test of the ability to recall the data, hypotheses, and evidential relations explored; and (c) the contents of a written essay. The results show that representational notations can have significant effects on learners' interactions, and may differ in their influence on subsequent collaborative use of the knowledge being manipulated. For example, Graph and Matrix users elaborated on previously represented information more than Text users. Representation and discussion of evidential relations was quantitatively greatest for Matrix users as predicted, yet this came at the cost of excessive consideration and revision of unimportant relations. Graph users may have been more focused in their consideration of evidence, and the work done in the Graph representation had the greatest impact on the contents of the essays. Although limited to initial use of representations in a laboratory setting, the work demonstrates that representational guidance of collaborative learning is worthy of study and suggests several lines of further investigation.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1202_2,[theory] Cognitive Load Theory; [theory] Distributed Cognition,[method] coding and categorization; [method] experimental design; [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [method] qualitative coding,[pedagogy] Cognitive Load Theory,,[setting] higher education,[subject] science,,[construct] collaboration; [construct] distributed cognition; [construct] representations,"Distributed Cognition, Cognitive Load Theory,experimental design, video analysis, qualitative coding,Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL),science, undergraduate classrooms, representational tools,collaboration, representations, reasoning",[theory] Cognitive Load Theory; [theory] Distributed Cognition; [method] coding and categorization; [method] experimental design; [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [method] qualitative coding; [pedagogy] Cognitive Load Theory; ; [setting] higher education; [subject] science; ; [construct] collaboration; [construct] distributed cognition; [construct] representations,,

Distributed scaffolding incorporates multiple forms of support that are provided through different means to address the complex and diverse learning needs that arise in such settings. I synthesize research to date to articulate three patterns of distributed scaffolding and the pedagogical considerations that they target. I introduce synergy as a pattern that has not received much attention in the past. Synergy refers to the characteristic that different components of distributed scaffolding, such as software supports and teacher coaching, address the same learning need and interact with each other to produce a robust form of support. I illustrate this pattern through classroom examples and discuss the scaffolding functions that it can fulfill.

555,Learning Processes in Chemistry: Drawing Upon Cognitive Resources to Learn About the Particulate Structure of Matter,Taber & García-Franco,2010,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article explores 11- to 16-year-old students' explanations for phenomena commonly studied in school chemistry from an inclusive cognitive resources or knowledge-in-pieces perspective that considers that student utterances may reflect the activation of knowledge elements at a range of levels of explicitness. We report 5 themes in student explanations that we consider to derive from implicit knowledge elements activated in cognition. Student thinking in chemistry has commonly been examined from a misconceptions or alternative conceptions/frameworks perspective, in which the focus has been on the status of learners' explicit conceptions. This approach has been valuable, but it fails to explain the origins or nature of the full range of alternative ideas reported. In physics education, the cognitive resources perspective has led to work to characterize implicit knowledge elements—described as phenomenological primitives (p-prims)—that provide learners with an intuitive sense of mechanism. School chemistry offers a complementary knowledge domain because of its focus on the nature of materials and its domination by theoretical models that explain observable phenomena in terms of emergent properties of complex ensembles of “quanticles” (molecules, ions, electrons, atoms, etc.) The themes reported in this study suggest a need to recognize primitive knowledge elements beyond those reported from physics education and suggest that some previously characterized p-prims may be better considered to derive from more broadly applicable intuitive knowledge elements.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400903452868,[theory] Conceptual Change Theory,[method] interview methods; [method] thematic analysis,,,[setting] secondary education,[subject] chemistry,,[construct] conceptual understanding,"Knowledge-in-Pieces (KiP), Cognitive Resources Framework, Conceptual Change Theory,qualitative interviews, thematic analysis,Conceptual Learning in Science,chemistry education, secondary classrooms, students aged 11–16,cognition, p-prims, conceptual change, implicit knowledge, particle model",[theory] Conceptual Change Theory; [method] interview methods; [method] thematic analysis; ; ; [setting] secondary education; [subject] chemistry; ; [construct] conceptual understanding,,

I specifically examined the contextual change of group work, which influenced opportunities to learn for newly arrived English language learners (ELLs). Based on analyses of video-recorded interactions, this study revealed a shift in these ELLs’ opportunities to learn from when they worked with teacher-assigned peers to when they worked with friends. In both settings, ELLs tended to be positioned as novices. However, when working with friends, they accessed a wider variety of work practices. In friend groups, ELLs were occasionally positioned as experts and had more opportunities to raise questions and offer ideas. In contrast, when working with teacher-assigned peers, ELLs tended to remain in the position of being helped.

Methods: Using collaborative ethnography, we describe how mathematical literacy was mobilized by an activist collective that intervened against violence toward migrant women. Our research considers a long period of development to examine how the activism impacted bodily politics, community, and relevant policies.Findings: Our findings illustrate how the collective of activists led by a migrant woman of color countered the official data that did not reveal marginalized voices. Critical synthesis of embodiment and emplacement allowed us to examine how the mobilization of mathematical literacy became consequential (Jurow et al., 2016) in two interrelated aspects: 1) embodiment, the process through which the historically hidden bodies of migrant women came to be visible and assembled and 2) emplacement, the transformation of a place toward gathering disparate bodies.Contribution: Our work contributes to expanding the geo-political terrain of scholarship in the learning sciences by bringing forth the history of activism led by Filipina migrants in Japan, which in turn shines a light on traditionally masked epistemology key to mobilizing mathematical literacy for solidarity.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2020.1820341,[theory] Critical Pedagogy; [theory] Embodied Cognition; [theory] Embodied Knowing / Embodiment,[method] multimodal analysis,[pedagogy] Embodied Learning,,,[subject] activism; [subject] mathematics,,,"Embodied Cognition, Emplaced Learning Theory, Critical Mathematics Education,ethnographic case study, multimodal discourse analysis,Activist Mathematics Pedagogy, Embodied Learning,mathematics education, community activism contexts,embodiment, emplacement, mathematical literacy, activism, transnationalism",[theory] Critical Pedagogy; [theory] Embodied Cognition; [theory] Embodied Knowing / Embodiment; [method] multimodal analysis; [pedagogy] Embodied Learning; ; ; [subject] activism; [subject] mathematics; ; ,,

The paper’s aim is to illuminate at what stages students provided with such feedback drop out of feedback processing.Methods: In our model, students can drop out at any of five stages of feedback processing: (1) noticing, (2) decoding, (3) making sense, (4) acting upon, and (5) using feedback to make progress. Eye-tracking was used to measure noticing and decoding of feedback. Behavioral data-logging tracked students’ use of feedback and potential progress. Three feedback signaling conditions were experimentally compared: a pedagogical agent, an animated arrow, and no signaling (control condition).Findings: Students dropped out at each stage and few made it past the final stage. The agent condition led to significantly less feedback neglect at the two first stages, suggesting that students who are not initially inclined to notice and read feedback text can be influenced into doing so.Contribution: The study provides a model and method to build more fine-grained knowledge of students’ (non)processing of feedback. More knowledge on at what stages students drop out and why can inform methods to counteract drop out and scaffold more productive and fruitful responses.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2020.1770092,,[method] experimental design; [method] Feedback analysis,[pedagogy] Scaffolding,[population] elementary education,,,,[construct] scaffolding,"Cognitive Feedback Processing Model, Game-Based Learning Theory,experimental design, eye-tracking and behavioral log analysis,Feedback-Enhanced Game-Based Learning, Digital Scaffolding,elementary education, digital game environment,feedback processing, attention, scaffolding, feedback neglect, learning mechanisms",; [method] experimental design; [method] Feedback analysis; [pedagogy] Scaffolding; [population] elementary education; ; ; ; [construct] scaffolding,,

The methods, issues, and findings of the current pilot experiment speak not only to the success of SimCalc MathWorlds, the focus of our research program, but also to the evaluation at scale of a broad class of representationally innovative technologies and to the merit of long-term investment in design-based research. In particular, we present conditions and findings from a completed pilot experiment involving 21 seventh-grade mathematics teachers from Texas. Pilot outcomes suggest that (a) innovative representational technologies can have an important impact on student learning, (b) considerable impact can be found across a wide range of teachers and conditions, and (c) these gains can be detected even in the absence of other desirable conditions. In particular, detection of student gains does not, in our case, depend on having a long-term context of learning, long-term teacher professional development, or a shift to learner-centered constructivist pedagogy.

The emphasis in this method is for an adult tutor to elicit solution suggestions from students and to explore the multiple solutions in seeking group agreement. The method focuses attention both on world representations underlying numbers and on transfer of problem solution planning skills to children over time. The results were compared with those from a modeling-reinforcement tutoring control condition and a classroom activity control in a 10-week study of fourth graders' solution of 4 types of 2-step math word problems, constructed to avoid keywords. Individuals who received either type of training earned higher scores for all problem types than did controls on quizzes; children in the modified reciprocal teaching condition outscored those in the modeling condition on problems that required information to be added from outside the problem and on a quiz of mixed problem types. Subsequent analysis of solutions and videotaped math behaviors suggested that those in the socially assisted learning condition used labeled representations in problem solving more effectively and deduced implied information earlier and more often than those in the modeling condition.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0602_2,[theory] Distributed Cognition; [theory] Social Constructivism,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [method] Microgenetic Method; [method] video study,[pedagogy] Collaborative Learning,[population] elementary education,,[subject] mathematics,,[construct] collaboration; [construct] distributed cognition; [construct] interaction; [construct] metacognition; [construct] problem solving,",distributed cognition,social constructivism,collaborative learning,,,microgenetic analysis,video-based observation,discourse analysis,,,,elementary education,mathematics education,small-group learning,,,problem solving,social interaction,metacognition,mathematical reasoning,",[theory] Distributed Cognition; [theory] Social Constructivism; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [method] Microgenetic Method; [method] video study; [pedagogy] Collaborative Learning; [population] elementary education; ; [subject] mathematics; ; [construct] collaboration; [construct] distributed cognition; [construct] interaction; [construct] metacognition; [construct] problem solving,,

Study 1 consisted of in situ analyses of children's shopping activities at a local store, revealing the variety of arithmetic tasks that emerged in relation to varied artifacts, shopping routines, social norms, and clerk support. In an effort to reveal competencies that could not be measured through observation alone, Study 2 consisted of individual interviews of 30 first and second graders about tasks that required them to purchase items at a mock store. Analyses revealed both strategies that were frequently and infrequently associated with successful purchasing and the relationship between children's strategy choices and the demands of particular purchases.

563,Measuring Complex Features of Science Instruction: Developing Tools to Investigate the Link Between Teaching and Learning,Thadani et al.,2009,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"There is a growing national recognition that teachers and teaching are at the heart of successful educational reform. However, few tools exist for measuring classroom instruction. The primary purpose of this article is to describe methods we developed to measure and study teaching, specifically while teachers were using a multimedia intervention for promoting scientific problem solving. Lessons were videotaped, and coding schemes were developed to measure 2 aspects of teaching: (a) the lesson's organization, particularly whole-class instruction used to introduce problems and share students' work; and (b) the nature of tasks and questions given to students. Results showed that the coding schemes were reliable and that they detected differences in instruction across teachers. Qualitative analyses were consistent with the quantitative findings. The codes also captured features of teaching that would have been difficult to detect or verify with qualitative observations alone. Finally, we explored how these measures could be used with student outcome data to examine the relationship between teaching and learning in future studies. We argue that quantitative measures of instruction serve many purposes, not the least of which is allowing researchers to explore the relationship between teaching and student learning at a high degree of granularity.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400902797941,,[method] participant observation; [method] validity testing,[pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Science Education (IBSE),,[setting] classrooms,[subject] science,,[construct] learning outcomes,"Inquiry-Based Science Education, Measurement Theory, Teacher Learning Framework,instrument development, validation study, classroom observation,Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL), Professional Development Design,science education, middle school classrooms, science teachers,measurement, instruction, fidelity, teacher practice, learning outcomes",; [method] participant observation; [method] validity testing; [pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Science Education (IBSE); ; [setting] classrooms; [subject] science; ; [construct] learning outcomes,,
564,What Can a Cognitive Coding Framework Reveal About the Effects of Professional Development on Classroom Teaching and Learning?,Thadani et al.,2017,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"We investigated what a cognitive framework for measuring classroom teaching could reveal about (a) the impact of a professional development (PD) program on teaching practices and (b) the relationship between teaching practices and student science learning. To conduct this study, we leveraged a collaboration between two entirely independent projects. The first project had developed a framework, the Teacher Tasks and Questions (TTQ) coding framework, for measuring teaching. The second project, the Science Teachers Learning From Lesson Analysis (STeLLA-1) project, possessed a rich body of teaching and student learning data. The two projects’ independence from each other allowed us to examine the generalizability of the TTQ framework and to investigate its validity. The TTQ measures were applied to the data set from the STeLLA-1 project. We examined whether the TTQ measures detected meaningful changes in teaching practice from pre-PD to post-PD and whether they predicted student learning. We found that the TTQ measures did detect changes in teaching practices that were consistent with STeLLA-1’s aims; furthermore, some TTQ measures also predicted student learning. We discuss the value of having generalizable measurement frameworks that can be used across different studies. We also glean lessons about data sharing across independent projects.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2017.1396220,,,,,,[subject] science,,,"Cognitive Coding Framework (TTQ), Teacher Learning Framework, Professional Development Framework,quantitative coding analysis, secondary data analysis,Professional Development for Science Teaching,science education, PD programs and classroom videos,teaching practices, PD effects, measurement, student learning, coding framework",; ; ; ; ; [subject] science; ; ,,
565,Engaging Girls’ Sociohistorical Identities in Science,Thompson,2014,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"What does it mean for ethnic minority girls, who have historically been marginalized by schools, to “see themselves” in science? Schools fail to create spaces for students to engage their identity resources in the learning of science or to negotiate and enact new science-related identities. This study investigates relationships among identity, engagement, and science discourse and provides a conceptual argument for how and why underserved ethnic minority girls engage in collective identity work, with science learning as a valued byproduct. The primary context for the study was Lunchtime Science, a 4-week lunchtime intervention for girls failing their science courses. There were 4 distinct ways the girls engaged in learning during Lunchtime Science: gleaning content for outside worlds, supporting the group, negotiating stories across worlds, and critiquing science. Each pattern had a signature profile with variations in the sociohistorical narratives used as resources, the positioning of one another as competent learners, and the type of science story critiqued and constructed. These findings indicate that when the girls were given opportunities to engage their personal narratives, and when science was open to critique, ethnic minority girls leveraged common historical narratives to build science narratives. Moreover, the girls’ identity work problematizes the commonplace instructional notion of “bridging” students’ everyday stories with science stories, which often privileges the science story and the composing of “science” identities. It also challenges researchers to investigate how the construction of narratives is broader than 1 community of practice, broader than 1 individual, and broader than 1 generation.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2014.888351,[theory] Communities of Practice; [theory] Critical Pedagogy,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA),[pedagogy] Communities of Practice; [pedagogy] Critical Pedagogy; [pedagogy] Feminist Pedagogy,,,[subject] science,,[construct] agency; [construct] engagement; [construct] identity,"Sociocultural Identity Theory, Feminist Pedagogy, Communities of Practice,ethnographic study, discourse analysis,Identity-Based Science Education, Critical Pedagogy,science education, ethnic minority girls, informal science program,identity, engagement, sociohistorical narrative, critique, empowerment",[theory] Communities of Practice; [theory] Critical Pedagogy; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [pedagogy] Communities of Practice; [pedagogy] Critical Pedagogy; [pedagogy] Feminist Pedagogy; ; ; [subject] science; ; [construct] agency; [construct] engagement; [construct] identity,,

570,Identity Construction Environments: Developing Personal and Moral Values Through the Design of a Virtual City,Umaschi Bers,2001,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"We live in a society where concepts of self, community, and ""what is right and wrong"" are constantly changing. This makes it particularly challenging for young people to construct a sense of self and to identify their most cherished values. Therefore, there is an amounting pressure in schools and society to create learning environments to explore these issues. Two research questions are at the heart of the work presented in this article: What kind of learning environment will afford opportunities for young people to naturally engage in reflection and discussion about issues of identity, in particular personal and moral values? and How can technologies have an impact on character and moral education? I propose identity construction environments (ICEs) as technological tools purposefully designed with the goal of supporting young people in the exploration of these issues. I first describe the design principles that distinguish these environments from other learning technologies. I also specify the learning experiences they do afford-namely the understanding of identity as a complex construction composed by different elements, including personal and moral values. Then I present the conceptual foundations and implementation of the Zora ICE. Zora is a three dimensional multi-user virtual environment that engages learners in the design of a graphical virtual city and its social organization. I describe a summer workshop conducted with a multicultural group of teenagers using Zora. They designed a virtual city populated with objects and characters representing aspects of themselves and their values. In this participatory microcommunity those values were put to test.

We describe the design of student-directed electronic portfolio assessments to characterize and “scaffold” collaborative inquiry using Knowledge Forum™. Our design involved asking students to identify exemplary notes in the computer discourse depicting knowledge building episodes using four knowledge building principles as criteria. We report three studies that examined the designs and roles of knowledge building portfolios with graduate and Grade 12 students in Hong Kong and Canada.

Thirty dyads of 15- to 18-year-old students participated in a writing task consisting of 3 phases. Students prepared by constructing a representation (text or diagram) individually. Then they discussed the topic and wrote a text in dyads. They consolidated their knowledge by revising their individual representation. There were 3 conditions: Students could use either (a) the individual texts they wrote, (b) the individual diagrams they constructed, or (c) a diagram that was constructed for them based on the text they wrote. Results showed that students who constructed a diagram themselves explored the topic more than students in the other conditions. We also found differences in the way collaborating dyads used their representations. Dyads who engaged in deep discussion used their representations as a basis for knowledge construction. In contrast, dyads who engaged in only shallow discussion used their representations solely to copy information to their collaborative text. We conclude that diagrammatic representations can improve collaborative learning, but only when they are used in a co-constructive way.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400701524785,[theory] Argumentation Theory,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] experimental design,,,,[subject] science,,[construct] argumentation; [construct] collaboration; [construct] reflection; [construct] representations,"Argumentation Theory, Representational Guidance Theory, CSCL Framework,experimental design, discourse analysis,Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), Argumentation-Based Learning,science, computer-supported environments, representational tools,argumentation, representation, collaboration, reflection, reasoning",[theory] Argumentation Theory; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] experimental design; ; ; ; [subject] science; ; [construct] argumentation; [construct] collaboration; [construct] reflection; [construct] representations,,

The frequency and quality of their use of the 4 steps from the MCT were then compared. The teachers who worked with the MCT increased their teaching quality more than the teachers who did not participate, especially with regard to the steps of contingent teaching. They also showed more complete cycles of contingent teaching at postmeasurement than the other teachers. Less successful teachers showed a tendency to provide less support because they mistakenly thought that prompting was not part of scaffolding. Future scaffolding research and professional development efforts aimed at promoting scaffolding can benefit from the MCT, provided that teachers’ understanding of scaffolding is closely monitored.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2013.805300,[theory] Scaffolding Theory; [theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] participant observation,[pedagogy] Collaborative Learning; [pedagogy] Scaffolding,,[setting] classrooms,,,[construct] collaboration; [construct] interaction; [construct] metacognition; [construct] scaffolding,"Scaffolding Theory, Sociocultural Theory, Dialogic Teaching,intervention study, classroom observation, discourse analysis,Scaffolding-Based Instruction, Collaborative Learning,general education, small-group classrooms,scaffolding, teacher talk, metacognition, guidance, interaction",[theory] Scaffolding Theory; [theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] participant observation; [pedagogy] Collaborative Learning; [pedagogy] Scaffolding; ; [setting] classrooms; ; ; [construct] collaboration; [construct] interaction; [construct] metacognition; [construct] scaffolding,,
575,Scaffolding Student Understanding in Small-Group Work: Students’ Uptake of Teacher Support in Subsequent Small-Group Interaction,van de Pol et al.,2018,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Providing contingent or adaptive support (i.e., scaffolding) is effective. Yet it is unclear how it promotes students’ learning. In this mixed-methods study, we investigated to what extent the effect of contingent support for students’ learning is mediated by the extent to which students take up teachers’ support in subsequent small-group work. We define contingent support as support that contains adapted levels of teacher control or regulation based on the learner’s level of understanding. To explore the research question, we analyzed all interactions from 35 lessons of 7 secondary social studies teachers and 7 small groups of students. Logistic multilevel mediation analyses showed that the likelihood of students formulating accurate answers during small-group work was higher when students applied the teacher’s support in subsequent small-group work (as opposed to ignoring that support). However, the contingency of a teacher’s support did not affect students’ uptake or the accuracy of their answers. Additional qualitative analyses showed that students’ uptake of contingent support was sometimes hampered by untimely fading of the support. Moreover, we found that contingent support that was then gradually faded was the most effective in fostering students’ uptake of a teacher’s support.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2018.1522258,[theory] Scaffolding Theory; [theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA),[pedagogy] Collaborative Learning; [pedagogy] Scaffolding,,,,,[construct] collaboration; [construct] interaction; [construct] scaffolding,"Scaffolding Theory, Sociocultural Theory, Dialogic Teaching,discourse analysis, video-based interaction analysis,Dialogic Scaffolding, Collaborative Learning,general education, classroom group work,scaffolding, uptake, dialogic support, teacher mediation, interaction",[theory] Scaffolding Theory; [theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [pedagogy] Collaborative Learning; [pedagogy] Scaffolding; ; ; ; ; [construct] collaboration; [construct] interaction; [construct] scaffolding,,
576,Achieving Alignment of Perspectival Framings in Problem-Solving Discourse,Van De Sande & Greeno,2012,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"We use a concept of framing to explain 3 cases in which participants initially lacked mutual understanding but then achieved significant mutual understanding. The cases were all consistent with a pattern of positional framing that includes a human participant who is inquiring, which we call a listener, and a source, which may be another human participant or a non-human system. Participants with these different positionings have different perspectives that shape the interpretations and functions of their contributions. We hypothesize that achievement of mutual understanding also depends on participants having epistemological and conceptual framings that are sufficiently aligned. We distinguish between cases in which the participants achieved alignment of conceptual framing by adopting a schema that was in their common ground, cases in which the participants co-constructed a coherent framing without the benefit of a prefabricated schema (by constraint satisfaction, we hypothesize), and cases in which mutual understanding involved a refinement that did not require reframing. We argue that our hypotheses qualify as explanatory mechanisms, and we explicate this in an appendix.Our general goal is to contribute to the growing body of scientific studies that include concepts and methods for understanding cognitive structures and processes integrated with concepts and methods for understanding interaction that people have with each other and with other material and informational systems.

577,Participants' Roles in the Context of a Video Club,Van Es,2009,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This study examines the nature of teacher participation in the context of a video club. Video clubs are professional development meetings in which teachers watch and discuss excerpts of video from their classrooms. In this study, I adopt a situative perspective to examine how teachers develop in their participation to accomplish the goals of the video club. In particular, I examine the roles participants play and explore teachers' participation in four roles that correspond with key goals of the video club. Analysis revealed that teachers' participation shifted in qualitatively different ways over time, with the teachers coming to prompt the group to discuss student mathematical thinking, to propose a variety of interpretations of student ideas, to build on one another's ideas, and to challenge one another's thinking in order to advance the group's conversations. This analysis suggests that the group learned how to participate in roles central to accomplishing the goals of the video club. Studying teacher learning through a lens of participation provides insight into the ways in which teachers coordinate themselves to engage with the goals of professional development and has implications for designing professional development that helps teachers develop practices for teaching mathematics for understanding.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508400802581668,[theory] Communities of Practice,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA),[pedagogy] Communities of Practice,[population] in-service teachers; [population] teachers,,,,[construct] discourse; [construct] participation; [construct] reflection,"Communities of Practice, Teacher Learning Framework, Video-Based Reflection Theory,discourse analysis, case study research,Video-Based Professional Development,teacher professional learning communities, in-service teachers,reflection, participation, role, professional vision, discourse",[theory] Communities of Practice; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [pedagogy] Communities of Practice; [population] in-service teachers; [population] teachers; ; ; ; [construct] discourse; [construct] participation; [construct] reflection,,
578,Youth Disciplinary Identification During Participation in Contemporary Project-Based Science Investigations in School,Van Horne & Bell,2017,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Recent science educational policy reform efforts call for a shift toward practice-focused instruction in kindergarten–Grade 12 science education. We argue that this focus on engaging students in epistemic practices of science opens up new possibilities for the design of learning environments that support the stabilization of learners’ science-linked identities. Learning environments often assume that youth come to them without relevant identity resources to contribute or that the learning environment has no bearing on the disciplinary identification of individuals. We conducted this research while developing a year-long course to teach high school biology by engaging youth in interest-driven projects focused on contemporary topics. We explored how engaging youth in the epistemic practices of science in culturally expansive ways supported their science-linked identification. We propose a model grounded in social practice theory that describes aspects of students’ stabilization of disciplinary identities. We found that (a) deepening participation in scientific practices is linked to whether or not youth have opportunities to coordinate their engagement with their existing identities; and (b) material, relational, and ideational identity resources and qualities of the learning environment mediate how youth stabilize disciplinary identities in interactional moments.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2017.1330689,[theory] Identity Theory; [theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA),,,,[subject] science,,[construct] belonging; [construct] participation,"Identity Theory, Sociocultural Theory, Project-Based Learning Framework,longitudinal ethnography, discourse analysis,Project-Based Science, Identity-Oriented Instruction,science education, middle school project classrooms,disciplinary identity, participation, belonging, inquiry, practice-linked identity",[theory] Identity Theory; [theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); ; ; ; [subject] science; ; [construct] belonging; [construct] participation,,

Two experiments were conducted for determination of an optimal dietary astaxanthin and FM (fish meal) ration for koi carp juveniles. In the first experiment, three isonitrogenous and isoenergetic dietary treatments were designed with three different levels of astaxanthin consisted of 60, 80 and 100 mg/kg and a commercial feed served as a control. For the second experiment, four isonitrogenous and isoenergetic dietary treatments were formulated with graded inclusions of dietary FM replaced from 0% to 60% at 20% increments by SM (soybean meal), PBM (poultry by-product meal), and a CD (control diet).

As such, there is growing interest in designing initiatives to help young people learn about data—not only the techno-mathematical skills necessary to work with data, but also the dispositions needed to participate in data-centric ways of knowing and doing. In this article, we argue that as this educational goal is pursued, it is important to attend to the normative scripts that are often associated with data, and how they relate to learners’ perspectives and prior experiences. We do this by examining two initiatives that aimed to help young people learn about data and its “real-world” applications by engaging them in participatory mapping activities, directed toward the study of local community challenges. We argue that when there are mismatches between students’ realities and how reality is described to work in data science, making the time and space to examine these contradictions can lead to a robust engagement with data science and its applications. These findings have implications for how we might better design tools and learning activities that connect data science with the broader contexts that frame young people’s lives.",https://doi.org/10.1080/10508406.2019.1693378,[theory] Critical Theory; [theory] Participatory Design,[method] Participatory Action Research (PAR); [method] Participatory Design Research,[pedagogy] Participatory Learning,,,,,[construct] data literacy; [construct] participation,"Participatory Design, Data Justice, Community Informatics,ethnographic fieldwork, participatory action research,Community-Based Data Science, Participatory Mapping,data literacy, community-based informal learning,civic engagement, participation, data justice, counter-narrative, co-production",[theory] Critical Theory; [theory] Participatory Design; [method] Participatory Action Research (PAR); [method] Participatory Design Research; [pedagogy] Participatory Learning; ; ; ; ; [construct] data literacy; [construct] participation,,
581,Learning 'How' Versus Learning 'When': Improving Transfer of Problem-Solving Principles,VanderStoep & Seifert,1994,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"How can problem solving be improved in domains where similar principles are learned? Aseries of three experimentsbased on Ross (1987) examinedhow instructing learners about when to apply problem-solving principles may later improve performance. In Experiment 1, subjects studied a similar pair (combinations and permutations)or a distinct pair (ambinations and conditionalprobability)of probability principles. Half of the subjects received information on when to apply the principles (applicability-instructions condition), whereas other subjects received instructionsthat reviewed how to solve problems using the principles (procedural-review condition). Subjects who received applicabilityinstructionsmade fewer confusion errors than subjects who received procedural-review instructionswhen learning the similar problem pair. However, this instructionalmanipulation had no effect when subjects were learning the distinct problem pair. Because applicability instructions affect confusion errors but not ovemll performance, they may improve the ability to identify when to apply a procedurebut may not improve memory for the formula or the ability to instantiate it. Experiment 2 supported this notion by showing that subjects given applicability instructions did better at selecting when to use each formula. Experiment 3 tested whethergivinglearnersthe pairs of examples to review together afforded them the opportunity to learn the applicability conditions on their own. The results showed that the important differencesbetween the principles (is., why the formulas apply in certain situations) must be identified in the instructional material because subjects were not likely to induce the differenceson their own. The results showed that when differencesbetween the related principles are identified in instructional material (is., why the formula applies in certain problems), these applicability instructionsmay serve to reduce confusionin noticing and selecting the relevant principle.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0301_3,[theory] Cognitive Skill Acquisition Theory,[method] experimental design,,,,,,,",cognitive skill acquisition,transfer of learning,analogical reasoning,,,experimental study,controlled design,transfer tasks,,,,college-level psychology,problem-solving instruction,,,procedural learning,conditional knowledge,strategy use,transfer performance,",[theory] Cognitive Skill Acquisition Theory; [method] experimental design; ; ; ; ; ; ,,
582,A Model of the Self-Explanation Effect,VanLehn et al.,1992,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Several investigators have taken protocols of students learning sophisticated skills, such as physics problem solving and LISP coding, by studying examples and solving problems. These investigations uncovered the self-explanation effect: Students who explain examples to themselves learn better, make more accurate self-assessments of their understanding, and use analogies more economically while solving problems. We describe a computer model, Cascade, that accounts for these findings. Explaining an example causes Cascade to acquire both domain knowledge and derivational knowledge. Derivational knowledge is used analogically to control search during problem solving. Domain knowledge is acquired when the current domain knowledge is incomplete and causes an impasse. If the impasse can be resolved by applying an overly general rule, then a specialization of the rule becomes a new domain rule. Computational experiments indicate that Cascade's learning mechanisms are jointly sufficient to reproduce the self-explanation effect, but neither alone can reproduce it.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0201_1,[theory] Cognitive Architecture; [theory] Cognitive Skill Acquisition Theory; [theory] Skill Acquisition Theory,[method] computational modeling; [method] experimental design; [method] protocol analysis,[pedagogy] Self-Explanation,,,,[technology] computational modeling,[construct] domain knowledge,",cognitive architecture,self-explanation,skill acquisition theory,,,computational modeling,protocol analysis,experimental study,,,,college-level physics,cognitive skill learning,problem-solving,,,self-explanation effect,analogical reasoning,domain knowledge,learning mechanisms,model simulation,",[theory] Cognitive Architecture; [theory] Cognitive Skill Acquisition Theory; [theory] Skill Acquisition Theory; [method] computational modeling; [method] experimental design; [method] protocol analysis; [pedagogy] Self-Explanation; ; ; ; [technology] computational modeling; [construct] domain knowledge,,
583,Rule-Learning Events in the Acquisition of a Complex Skill: An Evaluation of Cascade,VanLehn,1999,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Acquiring a complex cognitive skill often involves learning principles of the task domain in the midst of solving problems or studying examples. Cascade is a model of such learning. It includes both rule-based reasoning and several kinds of analogical, case-based reasoning. Task domain principles are represented as rules, and Cascade learns new rules at rule-learningevents, which are initiated by an impasse and utilize multiple kinds of reasoning. In this article, I evaluate Cascade's model of rule-learning events by analyzing ones gleaned from protocols of physics students solving problems and studying examples. As expected, Cascade's model is overly simple, but it appears feasible to extend it to cover all the observed learning events. The data themselves were surprising in that there are few learning events relative to the number that could have occurred, and those that did occur often involved forms of reasoning that are considerably shallower than expected. The data suggest ways that instruction can be improved to increase both the quantity and depth of learning events.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0801_3,[theory] Cognitive Modeling; [theory] Cognitive Skill Acquisition Theory,[method] Cognitive Modeling; [method] Microgenetic Method; [method] protocol analysis,,,[setting] higher education,[subject] physics; [subject] science,,[construct] metacognition; [construct] problem solving,",cognitive skill acquisition,explanation-based learning,impasse-repair-reflect model,,,protocol analysis,model-based evaluation,microgenetic study,,,,higher education,physics education,science education,,,Cascade model,rule learning,analogical reasoning,problem solving,metacognition,cognitive modeling,",[theory] Cognitive Modeling; [theory] Cognitive Skill Acquisition Theory; [method] Cognitive Modeling; [method] Microgenetic Method; [method] protocol analysis; ; ; [setting] higher education; [subject] physics; [subject] science; ; [construct] metacognition; [construct] problem solving,,

Other times, emotion remains implicit in analyses of learning. Methods: : Toward a more robust theorization of the relationship between learning and emotion, I present a sociocultural analysis of ethnographic fieldnotes and interviews with animal rights activists. Findings: : I present a sociocultural practice view on emotion, introducing “emotional configurations” to denote how emotion, rather than comprising universal and internal states, only becomes meaningful through entanglement with sense-making and situated practice in social activity. Analysis reveals two modes for emotion in learning: (1) as a condition of learning that drives learning along and (2) as a target of teaching and learning in its own right. I name “guided emotion participation” as a genre of activity that approaches emotional configurations as a learning target. Contribution: : Integrating sociocultural practice theory with emotion research provides new tools for analyzing emotion in learning. This study highlights how emotion is subject to norms, ideology, and power relations.

Moreover, this research has predominantly focused on adults’ perspectives of children’s play. Seeking to bring young children’s voices into methodological and design considerations, this study investigates children’s video interpretations of their mathematical play. Methods: : Leveraging data from a larger project that explores the integration of play in elementary mathematics classrooms, I draw upon sociocultural theory and critical childhood studies, as well as video-elicited interviews with four children, in order to examine play as both a context for mathematics learning, as well as a text for reading the mathematical worlds of young children. Findings: : Findings suggest that the four children drew upon sophisticated frames when making sense of video data, including situated conditions, networks of care, affective experiences, tangible fulfillment, and mathematical curiosities.

Yet this research does not typically foreground the history of relationships within focal interactions—a history we have found to be consequential to the ways embodied actions unfold. Through ethnographic and interactional analysis of the assistance students received in a tinkering afterschool program and the forms of assistance they enacted over time, we show how children supported one another using embodied movements that were embedded in relational histories and imbued with pedagogical and ethical values. We substantiate these findings by introducing the range of embodied movements identified within the setting, followed by a detailed analysis of three cases spanning distinct time-scales (5 minutes, 1 week, 3 years). The cases help establish the construct of embodied pathways, which we define as courses of possible action involving participants’ bodies and voices that model particular relations. We argue that the experience of receiving embodied assistance creates resources for mediation in the future, as seen in subsequent acts of guidance and solidarity across children.

Although the role of dialogue in learning has received much attention, the problem of creating situations in which students engage in epistemic dialogue has only begun to be addressed. This article highlights the set of factors that must be taken into account in designing a computer-supported collaborative learning situation that encourages students to discuss scientific notions. These factors include the choice of the domain issue, the activities proposed to students, and the role of technology. We describe the design of CONNECT, an integrated environment and task sequence for the collaborative confrontation, negotiation, and construction of text. Results are then presented from a study in which students individually wrote an interpretation of a sound phenomenon, were matched in dyads so as to maximize semantic differences between their texts, and then collaboratively discussed and wrote common texts across the network using CONNECT. We show how careful engineering of the CONNECT environment favors the occurrence of epistemic dialogue and creates opportunities for conceptual understanding. The discussion centers on why these opportunities might be missed, as well as on the conditions required for students to exploit them.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1101_3,[theory] Argumentation Theory; [theory] Epistemic Cognition; [theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [theory] Interaction Analysis,[pedagogy] Collaborative Learning,,[setting] classrooms,[subject] science,,[construct] argumentation; [construct] collaboration; [construct] epistemic cognition; [construct] explanation; [construct] understanding,"Sociocultural Theory, Epistemic Cognition, Argumentation Theory,Discourse Analysis, Interaction Analysis,Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL), Collaborative Learning,science, classroom, secondary students, computer-mediated dialogue,explanation, argumentation, reasoning, understanding",[theory] Argumentation Theory; [theory] Epistemic Cognition; [theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [theory] Interaction Analysis; [pedagogy] Collaborative Learning; ; [setting] classrooms; [subject] science; ; [construct] argumentation; [construct] collaboration; [construct] epistemic cognition; [construct] explanation; [construct] understanding,,
590,A Transfer-in-Pieces Consideration of the Perception of Structure in the Transfer of Learning,Wagner,2010,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Many approaches to the transfer problem argue that transfer depends on the recognition of the same or similar abstract structure in 2 different situations. However, mainstream cognitive perspectives and contrasting Piagetian constructivist accounts differ in their conceptualizations of structure. These differences, not clearly articulated in the literature, have significant implications for accounts of transfer. Using interview data involving undergraduates learning elementary principles of probability and statistics, and Wagner’s (2006) transfer-in-pieces perspective, I extend existing constructivist accounts of transfer in at least 2 ways. First, I show how the notion of a concept projection (diSessa & Wagner, 2005; Wagner, 2006) reveals fine-grained mechanisms of transfer that demonstrate how people structure situations and that elaborate on the Piagetian processes of assimilation and accommodation. Second, I examine how what experts consider a single mathematical concept or principle may come to be recognized through a variety of assimilatory cognitive resources whose usefulness is influenced by contextual factors. That is, an individual might structure 2 contextually dissimilar situations differently while perceiving the same mathematical principle at work in both. Similarly, 2 or more individuals may agree on the relevance of a particular mathematical concept in a situation, even though each structures the situation differently.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2010.505138,,[method] Qualitative Inquiry,,,[setting] higher education,[subject] mathematics,,[construct] structure; [construct] transfer,"Transfer-in-Pieces Framework, Constructivist Theory, Piagetian Assimilation–Accommodation Model,interview study, qualitative analysis,—,mathematics education, undergraduate classrooms,transfer, structure, assimilation, accommodation, concept projection",; [method] Qualitative Inquiry; ; ; [setting] higher education; [subject] mathematics; ; [construct] structure; [construct] transfer,,

This work utilizes methods such as Interaction Analysis and has attended to multiple dimensions and timescales of learning. It has redefined ideas about knowledge and competence and how they are acquired, thus providing important insights into the process of learning and the design of learning environments. However, we have not in the same way advanced our knowledge of teacher learning. Our understanding of the process and mechanism of teacher learning in in collaborative professional development (PD) environments is still quite thin. In this paper, we discuss how utilizing methods from Interaction Analysis, in particular, can offer insight into the process of teacher learning in these contexts. We illustrate how adopting a lens that shifts away from asking whether teachers are progressing toward a researcher-defined goal, toward one that asks how learning occurs in the moments of interaction, and the meaning it has for participants as they work to achieve PD goals, has the potential to shed new light on learning in teacher PD.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2019.1681998,[theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] Interaction / Video Analysis,,,[setting] teacher education,,,[construct] reflection,"Sociocultural Theory, Teacher Learning Framework, Microgenetic Analysis Framework,microgenetic interaction analysis, video analysis,Reflective Professional Learning, Teacher Inquiry,teacher education, professional development contexts,teacher learning, microdevelopment, practice change, interactional analysis, reflection",[theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; ; ; [setting] teacher education; ; ; [construct] reflection,,

We present three case studies of high school students whose classroom participation in a unit on the politically polarizing topic of climate change was informed by their political identities and how they situated themselves in climate change’s sociocultural, historical, and geologic context. We describe how these students, including two who initially rejected human-influenced climate change but revised their understandings, negotiating dissonant identities in the classroom through repeated engagement with conflicting political and scientific values, knowledge, and beliefs. These case studies problematize building bridges between formal and informal learning experiences and suggest that it may be necessary to leverage disconnections in addition to building connections across settings to promote productive identity work. The results further suggest that supporting climate change learning includes attending to identity construction across ecosocial timescales, including geologic time.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2017.1362563,,[method] Critical Discourse Analysis; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [theory] Interaction Analysis,,,,,,[construct] discourse; [construct] negotiation,"Sociopolitical Learning Theory, Identity Framework, Critical Discourse Analysis,qualitative case study, interaction analysis,Critical Science Pedagogy, Dialogue-Based Learning,environmental science education, high school classroom,political identity, ideology, discourse, climate change, negotiation",; [method] Critical Discourse Analysis; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [theory] Interaction Analysis; ; ; ; ; ; [construct] discourse; [construct] negotiation,,
593,Small-Group Reflections: Parallels Between Teacher Discourse and Student Behavior in Peer-Directed Groups,Webb et al.,2006,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Prior research on small-group collaboration identifies several behaviors that significantly predict student learning, such as exchanging explanations and applying help received. Previous reports focus on student behavior to understand why many students do not engage in behaviors predictive of learning, leaving unexplored how teachers may influence small-group interaction. Consequently, this article describes established teacher practices and examines whether and how students reproduce teacher discourse in the context of a semester-long program of cooperative learning in four middle school mathematics classrooms. This article illustrates changes that emerged and factors that made change difficult. The research concludes that student behavior largely mirrored the discourse modeled by and the expectations communicated by teachers. Teachers tended to give unlabeled calculations, procedures, or answers instead of labeled explanations. Teachers often instructed using a recitation approach in which they assumed primary responsibility for solving the problem, having students only provide answers to discrete steps. Finally, teachers rarely encouraged students to verbalize their thinking or to ask questions. Students adopting the role of help-giver showed behavior very similar to that of the teacher: doing most of the work, providing mostly low-level help, and infrequently monitoring other students’ level of understanding. The relatively passive behavior of students needing help corresponded to expectations communicated by the teacher about the learner as a fairly passive recipient of the teacher’s transmitted knowledge.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls1501_8,[theory] Social Constructivism; [theory] Sociocultural Theory,[method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [method] participant observation; [theory] Interaction Analysis,[pedagogy] Collaborative Learning; [pedagogy] Peer Learning / Teaching; [pedagogy] Scaffolding,,[setting] classrooms,[subject] mathematics,,[construct] collaboration; [construct] discourse; [construct] participation; [construct] reflection; [construct] scaffolding,"Sociocultural Theory, Social Constructivism,classroom observation, discourse analysis, interaction analysis,Collaborative Learning, Peer Learning,mathematics, elementary and middle school classrooms,discourse, reflection, collaboration, participation, scaffolding",[theory] Social Constructivism; [theory] Sociocultural Theory; [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [method] participant observation; [theory] Interaction Analysis; [pedagogy] Collaborative Learning; [pedagogy] Peer Learning / Teaching; [pedagogy] Scaffolding; ; [setting] classrooms; [subject] mathematics; ; [construct] collaboration; [construct] discourse; [construct] participation; [construct] reflection; [construct] scaffolding,,

In this article, we give examples of doing-oriented tools that might promote children’s ability to ""see"" significant abstract structures in mathematical situations. The reflection necessary for such seeing is motivated by activities and contexts that emphasize affective and social aspects. Natural language, as a representation already familiar to children, is key in these activities, both as a means of mathematical expression and as a link between situations and various abstract representations. These tools support: children’s ""ownership"" of a mathematical problem and its expression; remote sharing of problems and data; software interpretation of children’s own word problems; play with dynamically linked representations with attention to children’s prior connections; and systematic problem variation based on empirically determined level of difficulty.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1207/s15327809jls1302_3,[theory] Cognitive Load Theory; [theory] Cognitive Psychology,[method] experimental design,[pedagogy] Cognitive Load Theory; [pedagogy] Example-Based Learning,,[setting] elementary classrooms,[subject] mathematics,,[construct] problem solving; [construct] representations; [construct] transfer,"Cognitive Psychology, Cognitive Load Theory,experimental design,Example-Based Learning,mathematics, elementary classrooms,transfer, problem solving, representations",[theory] Cognitive Load Theory; [theory] Cognitive Psychology; [method] experimental design; [pedagogy] Cognitive Load Theory; [pedagogy] Example-Based Learning; ; [setting] elementary classrooms; [subject] mathematics; ; [construct] problem solving; [construct] representations; [construct] transfer,,

This article reports the results of an extended collaborative action research project in which teachers attempted to create the conditions for such dialogue by adopting an inquiry approach to the curriculum. A quantitative comparison between observations made early and late in the teachers’ involvement in the project showed a number of significant changes in the characteristics of teacher–whole-class discourse, with a shift toward a more dialogic mode of interaction. Nevertheless, the initiation-response-follow-up (IRF) genre continued to be pervasive.

Over the course of several extended problemsolving sessions, groups developed several successive alignments of participants and representations as they learned to solve increasingly difficult tasks. Our findings highlight the emergent and often unexpected meanings that learners established for representational tools as their groups reorganized into increasingly effective problem-solving ensembles. Our findings echo those of prior research regarding learners’ considerable competence and creativity in interpreting and applying distributed representational tools, as well as the careful coordination among learners involved in establishing and acting on those interpretations. Challenges in this design space include instances in our data where students capitalized on connections among representations without really trying to understand those connections, temporarily undermined the distributed character of the representations, and worked more efficiently by reducing the number of participants actively involved in breaking codes. Our findings indicate that managing these challenges requires presenting groups with regular opportunities to reconsider and reorganize their roles, and to experiment with different meanings and uses of flexible tools in the context of tasks with carefully sequenced levels of difficulty.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2010.542700,[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Distributed Cognition; [theory] Multiple Representations Theory,[method] Design-Based Research (DBR),[pedagogy] Collaborative Learning; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR),,,,,[construct] collaboration; [construct] distributed cognition,"Distributed Cognition, Representational Learning Theory, Collaborative Learning Framework,design-based research, classroom study,Collaborative Learning, Representational Learning,science and mathematics education, technology-enhanced classrooms,multiple representations, distribution, collaboration, cognitive load, design trade-offs",[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Distributed Cognition; [theory] Multiple Representations Theory; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Collaborative Learning; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); ; ; ; ; [construct] collaboration; [construct] distributed cognition,,

This has led to over a decade of calls to establish a corresponding field of Data Science Education. There is still a need, however, to more deeply conceptualize what a field of Data Science Education might entail in terms of scope, responsibility, and execution. This special issue explores how one distinguishing feature of Data Science—its focus on data collected from social and environmental contexts within which learners often find themselves deeply embedded—suggests serious implications for learning and education. The learning sciences is uniquely positioned to investigate how such contextual embeddings impact learners’ engagement with data including conceptual, experiential, communal, racialized, spatial, and political dimensions. This special issue demonstrates the richly layered relationships learners build with data and reveals them to be not merely utilitarian mechanisms for learning about data, but a critical part of navigating data as social text and understanding Data Science as a discipline.

599,"Patterns, Probabilities, and People: Making Sense of Quantitative Change in Complex Systems",Wilkerson-Jerde & Wilensky,2014,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The learning sciences community has made significant progress in understanding how people think and learn about complex systems. But less is known about how people make sense of the quantitative patterns and mathematical formalisms often used to study these systems. In this article, we make a case for attending to and supporting connections between the behavior of complex systems, and the quantitative and mathematical descriptions. We introduce a framework to examine how students connect the behavioral and quantitative aspects of complex systems and use it to analyze interviews with 11 high school students as they interacted with an agent-based simulation that produces simple exponential-like population growth. Although the students were comfortable describing many connections between the simulation’s behavior and the quantitative patterns it generated, we found that they did not readily describe connections between individual behaviors and patterns of change. Case studies suggest that these missed connections led students who engaged in productive patterns of sense-making to nonetheless make errors interpreting quantitative patterns in the simulation. These difficulties could be resolved by drawing students’ attention to the graph of quantitative change featured in the simulation environment and the underlying rules that generated it. We discuss implications for the design of learning environments, for the study of quantitative reasoning about complex systems, and for the role of mathematical reasoning in complex systems fluency.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2014.976647,,[method] Case Study Research; [method] interview methods,,[population] high school,,,,,"complex systems,quantitative reasoning,,interview,resource coding,case studies,,,,high school,math,quantitative patterns,,,agent-based simulations,patterns,modeling,levels of description,",; [method] Case Study Research; [method] interview methods; ; [population] high school; ; ; ; ,,

Research in cognitive semantics claims that the human conceptual capacity rests on a foundation of image schemas: topological patterns of spatial relations and simple dynamics abstracted from sensorimotor experience. A cognitive ethnography of elementary mathematics lessons in clock-reading reveals different image schemas used to read the hour for landmark times (three o’clock), relative times (a quarter past three), and absolute times (three fifteen). When considered together with the sequence of learning, the image schema analysis predicts the most common error observed in children’s time-telling while also revealing the source of latent errors that lead to sudden breakdowns. Comparison of the image-schematic structure of different levels of sophistication in reading “quarter past” times illustrates how enriched image-schematic structure interrelates different aspects of time-telling, supporting flexible performance in novel situations. Relating visible actions to these aspects of ongoing conceptualization will help experts provide a more complete account of embodied mathematical cognition, teaching, and learning.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2011.553259,[theory] Cognitive Ethnography; [theory] Cognitive Semantics; [theory] Embodied Cognition; [theory] Mathematical Cognition,[method] Ethnography; [method] interview methods; [method] participant observation,,,[setting] elementary classrooms,,,[construct] expertise; [construct] observation,",embodied cognition,mathematical cognition,cognitive semantics,,,ethnography,cognitive ethnography,video,interviews,artifact analysis,observation,,,,elementary school,time-telling,,,image schema,sequence of learning,overgeneralization,expertise,",[theory] Cognitive Ethnography; [theory] Cognitive Semantics; [theory] Embodied Cognition; [theory] Mathematical Cognition; [method] Ethnography; [method] interview methods; [method] participant observation; ; ; [setting] elementary classrooms; ; ; [construct] expertise; [construct] observation,,

This study examines how mathematical play and learning manifest in older children in a mathematical videogame designed by the first author, Rolly’s Adventure. We examined how players experienced mathematical play as they played Rolly’s Adventure, with a particular focus on failure paired with feedback. We used video and audio recordings of the players and their bodies, and screen capture of their gameplay. Spoken language, physical gestures, and digital actions were our primary sources of identifying, understanding, and triangulating mathematical play. We found that players pass through five zones of mathematical play that build upon each other and closely interrelate, and that these zones each involve different types of failure, feedback, and learning experiences.

However, educational video games bring together two historically disparate activities: school mathematics and video games. How these two activities complement, compromise, or contradict each other influences how mathematical activity takes shape during game play. Methods: : This paper offers a case analysis of two students: one who engages with the mathematics as intended by the game and is easily seen as on task, and a second who seems to reject the mathematics as intended by the game and is easily seen as off task. The analysis focuses on how each student’s frame of activity influences their mathematical activity during game play. Findings: : Findings suggest that, considered from their own frame of activity instead of the frame of the design, both students appear engaged in mathematical sensemaking, albeit in different ways: one as intended by the designer, the other as emerging from game play.

This in turn can influence a shift in how students interpret the nature of socioscientific issues toward a more complex understanding. Results of the intervention show that among this population of 76 Grade 7 students, rules by which students selected whom to talk to in paired discussions about a complex socioscientific issue shifted from nonreflective or socially driven mechanisms (e.g., waiting for any random person) to reflective or information-driven mechanisms (e.g., specifically choosing someone who had a lot of knowledge).

610,Comparing Simple and Advanced Video Tools as Supports for Complex Collaborative Design Processes,Zahn et al.,2010,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Digital video technologies, particularly advanced video tools with editing capabilities, offer new prospects for meaningful learning through design. However, it is also possible that the additional complexity of such tools does not advance learning. In an experiment, we compared the design processes and learning outcomes of 24 collaborating participant pairs (dyads), using two contrasting types of video tools for history learning. The advanced video tool, WebDiver, supported segmenting, editing and annotating capabilities. In the contrasting condition, students used a simple video playback tool with a word processor to perform the design task. Results indicate that the advanced video editing tool was more effective in relation to (1) the students’ understanding of the topic and cognitive skills acquisition (2) the quality of the student’s design products (3) the efficiency of dyad interactions. The implications of our experimental findings for constructivist and design-based learning are that mediating functions of video tools may be used as supports, for example, when students learn by solving design tasks in school.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508401003708399,[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Knowledge Building (KB),[method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] longitudinal study,[pedagogy] Collaborative Learning; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR),,[setting] K–12 education,,,[construct] collaboration; [construct] knowledge; [construct] metacognition,"Knowledge Building Theory, Collective Cognitive Responsibility Framework, Design-Based Research (DBR),design-based research, longitudinal study,Knowledge Building (KB), Collaborative Learning,science and literacy education, K–12 classrooms, online knowledge forum,knowledge building, collective responsibility, collaboration, metacognition, idea improvement",[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Knowledge Building (KB); [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] longitudinal study; [pedagogy] Collaborative Learning; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); ; [setting] K–12 education; ; ; [construct] collaboration; [construct] knowledge; [construct] metacognition,,
611,Using Questioning to Guide Student Thinking,Zee & Minstrell,1997,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This case study analyzes ways in which an experienced physics teacher uses questioning to guide student thinking during a benchmark discussion about measurement. Interactional issues involve ways of speaking: Why the teacher decided to ask what he did, when he did, of whom, in what way, and for what purpose. Conceptual issues involves ways of thinking: How students seemed to understand measurement concepts such as calculating an average value. We define a particular kind of question, a reflective toss, that the teacher uses to try to give students responsibility for thinking. A reflective toss sequence typically consists of a student statement, teacher question, and additional student statements. This unit of analysis directs attention to ways in which a teacher question influences student thinking. We analyze reflective tosses in terms of the immediate action plans they instantiated, the emergent goals they served, anal underlying beliefs they embodied during an episode that involved the public refinement of a student's ideas. We propose that teachers may shift toward more reflective discourse by asking questions that help students to make their meanings clear, to consider various points of view in a neutral manner, and to monitor the discussion and their own thinking.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0602_3,,[method] Ethnography; [method] field notes,[pedagogy] formative assessment; [pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL); [pedagogy] Scaffolding,[population] high school,[setting] classrooms,[subject] physics; [subject] science,,[construct] agency; [construct] discussion; [construct] engagement; [construct] epistemic agency; [construct] Epistemic Agency; [construct] metacognition; [construct] reflection; [construct] scaffolding,",inquiry-based learning,formative assessment,reflective discourse,metacognition,,,ethnography,ethnography of communication,classroom recording,debriefing session,field notes,,,,science education,physics education,classroom,high school,teacher,,,action plans,goals,beliefs,discussion,engagement,questioning,scaffolding,epistemic agency,reflection,",; [method] Ethnography; [method] field notes; [pedagogy] formative assessment; [pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL); [pedagogy] Scaffolding; [population] high school; [setting] classrooms; [subject] physics; [subject] science; ; [construct] agency; [construct] discussion; [construct] engagement; [construct] epistemic agency; [construct] Epistemic Agency; [construct] metacognition; [construct] reflection; [construct] scaffolding,,

Thirty-nine Knowledge Building initiatives, each focused on a curriculum theme and facilitated by nine teachers over eight years, were analyzed using measures of student discourse in a Knowledge Building environment–Knowledge Forum. Results were analyzed from the perspective of student, teacher, and principal engagement to identify conditions for Knowledge Building as a school-wide innovation. Analyses of student discourse showed interactive and complementary contributions to a community knowledge space, conceptual content of growing scope and depth, and collective responsibility for knowledge advancement. Analyses of teacher and principal engagement showed supportive conditions such as shared vision and trust in student competencies to the point of enabling transfer of agency for knowledge advancement to students; everdeepening understanding of Knowledge Building principles; knowledge emergent through collective responsibility; a coherent systems perspective; teacher professional Knowledge Building communities; and leadership supportive of innovation at all levels. More substantial advances for students were related to years of teachers’ experience in this progressive knowledge-advancing enterprise.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2011.528317,[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Knowledge Building (KB); [theory] Organizational Learning Theory; [theory] Systems Theory,[method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] longitudinal study,[pedagogy] Collaborative Learning; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR),[population] elementary education,,,,[construct] innovation; [construct] knowledge; [construct] sustainability,"Knowledge Building Theory, Organizational Learning Theory, Innovation Diffusion Framework,design-based research, longitudinal case study,Knowledge Building (KB), Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL),elementary education, school-level innovation, online knowledge forum,sustainability, innovation, knowledge building, collective responsibility, teacher collaboration",[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [theory] Knowledge Building (KB); [theory] Organizational Learning Theory; [theory] Systems Theory; [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] longitudinal study; [pedagogy] Collaborative Learning; [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [population] elementary education; ; ; ; [construct] innovation; [construct] knowledge; [construct] sustainability,,
614,Strategic Facilitation of Problem-Based Discussion for Teacher Professional Development,Zhang et al.,2011,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Engaging teachers in discussing and analyzing problems of practice has great potential for teacher professional development, yet little is known about how to facilitate such discussion. This study examined the strategies that experienced facilitators used to promote productive discussion among science teachers. Participants were 6 facilitators and 35 in-service teachers who participated in a professional development program that adopted a problem-based learning approach for teacher learning. Data analysis showed that experienced facilitators used a variety of strategies in their facilitation, including questioning, revoicing, making connections, clarifying, reframing, summarizing, role playing, meta-talk, and modeling. In particular, questioning and revoicing were the most important strategies in all sessions studied, accounting for about half of the facilitators’ talk. Analysis further revealed both productive and disruptive characteristics of questioning and revoicing. In addition, analysis found that teachers were able to make progress in participating in the problem-based learning discourse in different ways. This study has implications for research on teacher professional development, problem-based learning, and learner-centered instruction.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2011.553258,[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR),[method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Discourse Analysis (DA),[pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Problem-Based Learning (PBL),,[setting] teacher education,,,[construct] collaboration; [construct] discourse,"Knowledge Building Theory, Professional Learning Framework, Facilitation Theory,design-based research, discourse analysis,Problem-Based Learning (PBL), Professional Development Design,teacher education, online professional communities,facilitation, discourse, collaboration, professional growth, knowledge advancement",[theory] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Design-Based Research (DBR); [method] Discourse Analysis (DA); [pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR); [pedagogy] Problem-Based Learning (PBL); ; [setting] teacher education; ; ; [construct] collaboration; [construct] discourse,,

Different from supporting inquiry using predesigned structures, we propose reflective structuration as a social and temporal mechanism by which members of a community coconstruct/reconstruct shared inquiry structures to shape and guide their ongoing knowledge building processes.

612,Designs for Collective Cognitive Responsibility in Knowledge-Building Communities,Zhang et al.,2009,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article reports a design experiment conducted over three successive school years, with the teacher’s goal of having his Grade 4 students assume increasing levels of collective responsibility for advancing their knowledge of optics. Classroom practices conducive to sustained knowledge building were co-constructed by the teacher and students, with Knowledge Forum software supporting the production and refinement of the community’s knowledge. Social network analysis and qualitative analyses were used to assess online participatory patterns and knowledge advances, focusing on indicators of collective cognitive responsibility. Data indicate increasingly effective procedures, mirrored in students’ knowledge advances, corresponding to the following organizations: (a) Year 1—fixed small-groups; (b) Year 2—interacting small-groups with substantial cross-group knowledge sharing; and (c) Year 3—opportunistic collaboration, with small teams forming and disbanding under the volition of community members, based on emergent goals. The third-year model maps most directly onto organic and distributed social structures in real-world knowledge-creating organizations and resulted in the highest level of collective cognitive responsibility, knowledge advancement, and dynamic diffusion of information.

616,The Role of Extreme Case Reasoning in Instruction for Conceptual Change,Zietsman & Clement,1997,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Although it is common to see extreme case reasoning included in lists of expert heuristics for problem solving, little work has been reported on the role that extreme cases can play in learning that leads to conceptual change. Evidence is presented from video tapes of think-aloud tutoring sessions to document the learning from extreme cases in a unit about levers for seventh graders. The observations support the view that one role of extreme cases is to provide a firm data point or comparison that helps students to establish an ordinal relation between two given variables. Two new additional roles for extreme cases in fostering learning are also identified: (a) their role in activating an intuition, often in the form of a perceptual motor schema, that is used in constructing an imageable, intuitively, grounded, explanatory model as opposed to an empirical role; and (b) their role in facilitating the formation of new causal variables. Pending confirmation of similar effects in other subject areas, these roles are candidates for being included in a set of general learning strategies for science instruction. This illustrates the function that ""learning-aloud"" studies can play in documenting new types of learning processes and instructional strategies. The study highlights the importance for instructional design of research that uncovers students' existing knowledge structures and natural reasoning processes. The study suggests that explanatory model construction, causal relation construction, and concept formation can result from such instructional designs. The extent to which these three outcomes are evidence for strong conceptual change is also discussed.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0601_4,,[method] Case Study Research; [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [method] think-aloud protocols; [method] transcript analysis,[pedagogy] Metacognitive Strategy Instruction,[population] middle school,,[subject] physics; [subject] science,[technology] intelligent tutoring systems,[construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] explanation,",conceptual change,explanatory models,perceptual motor schema,analogical reasoning,,,think-aloud,qualitative inquiry,case study,video analysis,transcript analysis,clinical interviews,,,,science education,physics education,middle school,tutoring sessions,,,extreme case reasoning,causal reasoning,misconceptions,preconceptions,lever concept,anchoring intuitions,model construction,variable formation,classroom instruction design,",; [method] Case Study Research; [method] Interaction / Video Analysis; [method] think-aloud protocols; [method] transcript analysis; [pedagogy] Metacognitive Strategy Instruction; [population] middle school; ; [subject] physics; [subject] science; [technology] intelligent tutoring systems; [construct] conceptual understanding; [construct] explanation,,
617,Higher Order Thinking Skills and Low-Achieving Students: Are They Mutually Exclusive?,Zohar & Dori,2003,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Fostering students’ higher order thinking skills is considered an important educational goal. Although learning theories see the development of students’ thinking as an important goal for all students, teachers often believe that stimulating higher order thinking is appropriate only for high-achieving students. According to this view, low-achieving students are, by and large, unable to deal with tasks that require higher order thinking skills and should thus be spared the frustration generated by such tasks. Because this view may cause teachers to treat students in a nonegalitarian way, it is important to find out whether or not it is supported by empirical evidence. The goal of this study is to examine this issue in light of four different studies, by asking the following question: Do low-achieving students gain from teaching and learning processes that are designed to foster higher order thinking skills? Each of the4 studies addressed a different project whose goal was to teach higher order thinking in science classrooms. Following a brief general description of each project, we provide an analysis of its effects on students with low and high achievements. The findings show that by the end of each of the 4 programs, students with high academic achievements gained higher thinking scores than their peers with low academic achievements. However, students of both subgroups made considerable progress with respect to their initial score. In one of the 4 studies the net gain of low achievers was significantly higher than for high achievers. Our findings strongly suggest that teachers should encourage students of all academic levels to engage in tasks that involve higher order thinking skills.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1202_1,,[method] comparative analysis,,,,[subject] science,,,",higher order thinking skills,,,,comparative analysis,,,science education,,,4 studies combination,",; [method] comparative analysis; ; ; ; [subject] science; ; ,,
618,The Nature and Development of Teachers' Metastrategic Knowledge in the Context of Teaching Higher Order Thinking,Zohar,2006,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This study examines the development of teachers’ metastrategic knowledge (MSK), a component of metacognitive knowledge, in the context of higher order thinking. Participants were 14 junior high school and high school science teachers who attended a professional development course. Data collection was carried out by triangulation of several data sources: classroom observations, individual interviews, written assignments, and recordings of discussions that took place during the course. The Findings section provides a detailed analysis of the professional development of 2 teachers, as well as an analysis of the development of the 14 teachers as a group. The data provide evidence for the types of knowledge teachers need for applying MSK in the course of instruction, the most specific of which are MSK of thinking skills (that must be explicit) and pedagogical knowledge regarding MSK. The considerable overall development in teachers’ MSK following an in-service course consisted of at least 3 different patterns of development: (a) learning MSK regarding new thinking skills, (b) transforming initially implicit metalevel knowledge into explicit metalevel knowledge, and (c) introducing changes in the class culture to value new forms of discourse regarding thinking.
