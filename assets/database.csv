"Interaction, Comprehension, and Instruction Usage",Alterman et al.,1991,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article explores the learning of common practice in a community of agents. We focus on how learning occurs ""out in the world,"" rather than on learning as it occurs in the classroom. The emphasis of this article is that much of the learning of practice is guided by comprehension processes. We take as prima facie evidence for this the ubiquitousness of instructions. We present a concrete model of the comprehension processes that occur when interacting with an unfamiliar device. An important focus is on the usage of instructions.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.1991.9671975,[framework] Communities of Practice;[framework] Situated Cognition;,[pedagogy] Communities of Practice;,[method] Case Study Research;,,adaptability;conceptual understanding;inclusion;,,,
Causal Models and Experimentation Strategies in Scientific Reasoning,Schauble et al.,1991,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This study explores how novices' conceptions about electric circuits affected their self-directed experimentation in a computer-based circuit laboratory. The participants, 22 undergraduates with no formal college instruction in physics, worked individually on an initial problem to assess their conceptual models of circuits and in subsequent sessions on open-ended experimentation with the computer laboratory, attempted to rediscover the laws of electric circuits. Analysis of the initial problem identified four conceptual models in students' solutions. Lower level models were local, piecemeal, and represented the surface features of the materials, whereas higher level models were progressively more cohesive, integrated, and principled. Relationswere found between students' causal models and their learning gains in the computer laboratory. Good and poor learners with the laboratory were identified; these groups showed strategic differencesin goal-directedplanning, generating and interpreting evidence, and managing data. In general, sophisticatedmodels in the initial problem were related to sophisticated reasoning in the computer discovery task. It is suggested that research oriented to the improvement of science learning should attend to interactive relationships between prior conceptions, inference strategies, and the structure of domain-specific knowledge.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0102_3,,,[method] Case Study Research;[method] Interview Methods;,[setting] higher education;[subject] physics;[subject] science;,,,,
Functionality in Analogical Transfer: A Hard Match is Good to Find,Hammond et al.,1991,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article is concerned with the study of analogy and memory as viewed from the perspectives of both artificial intelligence (AI) and psychology. Its aim is to combine what seem to be two distinct and conflicting approaches to memory-the functional approach of A1 and the empirical approach of psychology-and propose a unified view that does not compromise the nature of either field yet resolves the existing conflicts between them. To do this we propose a shift away from the narrow view of analogical reminding as an isolated memory behavior and toward a more general view of memory as a process that serves the needs of planning, problem solving, and understanding. This shift involves changes to both the functional arguments that have arisen in A1 and a reexamination of the empirical evidence that has been presented in psychology.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0102_1,,,[method] Comparative Analysis;,,mediation;memory;problem solving;,,,
"Learning to Predict and Explain: An Integration of Similarity-Based, Theory-Driven, and Explanation-Based Learning",Pazzani,1991,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"We analyze the types of information that human learners rely on in the acquisition of predictive and explanatory knowledge. We present OCCAM, a computational model of this learning task that integrates three learning methods: similarity-based learning (SBL), explanation-based learning (EBL), and theory-driven learning (TDL). We focus on the strengths and weaknesses of each learning method and describe how they can be integrated in a complementary fashion. The goal of this integration is to provide a learning architecture that accounts for the effects of prior knowledge on human learning. The integration helps to explain how a learner can learn rapidly when new experiences are consistent with prior knowledge while still retaining the ability to learn in novel domains (although more slowly). In addition, we present experimental evidence that an integrated model converges on accurate concepts more rapidly than either method applied individually. OCCAM is unique among learning models in that it can make use of data-intensive learning methods to acquire the knowledge needed for knowledge-intensive learning.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0102_2,[framework] Theory-Driven Learning (TDL);,,[method] Computational Modeling;[method] Experimental Design;,[technology] computational modeling;,evidence;,,,
A Theory of Questions and Question Asking,Ram,1991,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article focuses on knowledge goals, that is, the goals of a reasoner to acquire or reorganize knowledge. Knowledge goals, often expressed as questions, arise when the reasoner's model of the domain is inadequate in some reasoning situation. This leads the reasoner to focus on the knowledge it needs, to formulate questions to acquire this knowledge, and to learn by pursuing its questions. I develop a theory of questions and of question asking, motivated both by cognitive and computational considerations, and I discuss the theory in the context of the task of story understanding. I present a computer model of an active reader that learns about novel domains by reading newspaper stories.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.1991.9671973,[framework] Cognitive Theory;,,[method] Computational Modeling;,[subject] literacy;[technology] computational modeling;[technology] mobile devices;,creativity;knowledge;,,,
Empowering the Student: New Perspectives on the Design of Teaching Systems,Schank & Jona,1991,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Most efforts in making computer-based teachers have not tried to change the standard teaching methods commonly used in schools today to any significant degree. We survey several of these methods of teaching and examine both their strengths and weaknesses. We then introduce six new teaching architectures, defined as a kind of general blueprint or framework that embodies a particular approach to teaching. We argue that using the power of the computer-based teaching medium, such teaching architectures can be designed to exploit the strengths of standard teaching methods while avoiding many of the pitfalls. Finally, we present a perspective on the role of computers in education, arguing that one of the main problems facing education today is students lack of control over the instruction they receive. As a first step in remedying this problem, we propose that educational software should provide students with a set of ""teaching buttons"" that will allow them to communicate easily with a computer-based teacher and thus more fully gain control over their interaction with the system. An example of the current version of our set of teaching buttons is also presented.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0101_2,[framework] Conceptual Design;,,[method] Comparative Analysis;,[technology] computer-based instruction;,,,,

Plausible Generalization: Extending a Model of Human Plausible Reasoning,Burstein et al.,1991,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Transcripts of people answering questions or carrying on dialogues about everyday matters are filled with plausible inferences-inferences that are not certain, but that make sense. The same patterns of inferences occur in many different contexts. Often, in forming these inferences, people make generalizations that are equally uncertain but nevertheless are useful guides to reasoning. This article describes some important extensions to our earlier description of a core theory of plausible reasoning, based in large part on a new protocol study. The extensions are both data driven and theory driven. The primary focus here is on the inductive inference patterns people use to form plausible generalizations, that is, weakly held beliefs based on few examples but annotated with the same forms of certainty and similarity information that supported the inferential patterns described in our earlier work. We also provide examples of qualitative reasoning with inequalities and extend our formalism to cover that type of reasoning.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.1991.9671974,,,[method] Computational Modeling;[method] Discourse Analysis;[method] Protocol Analysis;,[technology] computational modeling;,trust;,,,
Higher Levels of Agency for Children in Knowledge Building: A Challenge for the Design of New Knowledge Media,Scardamalia & Bereiter,1991,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Although adults and children both have zones of proximal development in which more knowledgeable others play essential roles, there is a difference in executive control that is most salient in question-answer dialogue. Adult learners typically ask questions based on their perceived knowledge needs, whereas with school children, questions are typically asked by the teacher, based on the teacher's perception of the child's needs. Evidence shows that children can produce and recognize educationally productive questions and can adapt them to their knowledge needs. The challenge is to design environments in which students can use such questions to guide their building of knowledge, thus assuming a higher level of agency in learning. Computer Supported Intentional Learning Environments (CSILE), a computer-supported knowledge medium designed to support intentional learning, is described, with illustrations of children's use of it in cooperative knowledge building.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0101_3,[framework] Conceptual Framework;[framework] Knowledge Building (KB);,,,[population] children;[population] teachers;[setting] classrooms;,agency;collaboration;,,,
Three Levels of Goal Orientation in Learning,Ng & Bereiter,1991,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Sixteen adult volunteers provided thinking-aloud protocols while undergoing a 10-hr individually administered course in BASIC (beginner's all-purpose symbolicinstruction code) programming. Three levels of goals were identified as operative in the learning situation: task-completion goals, instructional goals, and personal knowledge-building goals. Although protocol statements indicating knowledge-building goals were infrequent, students exhibiting a relatively high proportion of them were distinctive in several ways. They did significantly better on a posttest. Their performance in goal cue selections differed from that of other participants in ways consistent with their orientation: They responded more often to learning goal cues than to task goal cues. They actively related new learning to prior knowledge and they posed and tried to solve problems and questions. Students oriented toward instructional goals tended to focus on what was explicitly taught. Students oriented toward task-completion goals tended to equate learning with successful completion of assigned tasks. Level of goal orientation and posttest performance were unrelated to level of education and prior computer experience but were positively related to previous experience of independent learning",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.1991.9671972,,,[method] Experimental Design;[method] Think-Aloud Protocols;,[population] adult learners;[subject] computer science / programming;[technology] computer-based instruction;,gender;motivation;,,,
The Content of Physics Self-Explanations,Chi & VanLehn,1991,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Several earlier studies have found the amount learned while studying worked-out examples is proportional to the number of self-explanations generated while studying examples. A self-explanation is a comment about an example statement that contains domain-relevant information over and above what was stated in the example line itself. This article analyzes the specific content of self-explanations generated by students while studying physics examples. In particular, the content is analyzed into pieces of constituent knowledge that were used in the comments. These were further analyzed in order to trace the source of knowledge from which selfexplanations could be generated. The results suggest that there are two general sources for self-explanations. The first is deduction from knowledge acquired earlier while reading the text part of the chapter, usually by simply instantiating a general principle, concept, or procedure with information in the current example statement. The second explanation is generalization and extension of the example statements. Such construction of the content of the example statements yield new general knowledge that helps complete the students' otherwise incomplete understanding of the domain principles and concepts. The relevance of this research for instruction and models of explanation-based learning is discussed.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0101_4,[framework] Self-Explanation Theory;,[pedagogy] Example-Based Learning;,[method] Think-Aloud Protocols;,,conceptual understanding;,,,

Effective Tutoring Techniques: A Comparison of Human Tutors and Intelligent Tutoring Systems,Merrill et al.,1992,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"There has been much debate about instructional strategies for computerized learning environments. Many of the arguments designed to choose between the various philosophies have appealed, at least implicitly, to the behavior of effective human teachers. In this article, we compare the guidance and support offered by human tutors with that offered by intelligent tutoring systems. First, we review research on human tutoring strategies in various domains. Then we investigate the capabilities of a widely used technique for providing feedback, model tracing. Finally, we contrast the types of guidance and support provided by human tutors with those in intelligent tutoring systems, by examining the process of recovering from impasses encountered during problem solving. In general, the support offered by human tutors is more flexible and more subtle than that offered by model tracing tutors, but the two are more similar than sometimes argued.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0203_2,[framework] Cognitive Skill Acquisition Theory;,,[method] Comparative Analysis;[method] Experimental Design;[method] Protocol Analysis;,[setting] higher education;[technology] human–computer interaction;[technology] intelligent tutoring systems;,failure;fairness;safety;,,,

Studying Children's Learning in Context: Problems and Prospects,Saxe,1992,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"In this article, I present a framework for the study of children's learning in cultural practices and educational activities. The framework consists of three analytic components, each of which is grounded in a constructivist treatment of cognitive development: (a) a model for the analysis of emergent cognitive goals in practices, (b) a model for the analysis of cognitive developments linked to emergent goals, and (c) a model for the analysis of the interplay between cognitive developments linked to one practice or activity to accomplish emergent goals in another. The article describes the early history of the framework and its current application to the design and analysis of a classroom practice in the United States involving arithmetical problem solving in third and fourth grade inner-city classrooms.

Appropriating Scientific Discourse: Findings From Language Minority Classrooms,Rosebery et al.,1992,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"We report a study of the effects of a collaborative inquiry approach to science on language minority students' (middle and high school) learning. The emphasis in this approach is on involving the students, most of whom have never studied science before and some of whom have had very little schooling of any kind, in ""doing science"" in ways that practicing scientists do. The question addressed in this study is, To what extent do students appropriate scientific ways of knowing and reasoning as a result of their participation in collaborative scientific inquiry? The focus of our analysis was on changes in students' conceptual knowledge and use of hypotheses, experiments, and explanations to organize their reasoning in the context of two think aloud problems. In September the students' reasoning was nonanalytic and bound to personal experience. They responded as if they were being asked to answer questions in a reading comprehension task. In contrast, by June they reasoned in terms of a larger explanatory system, used hypotheses to organize and give direction to their reasoning, and demonstrated an awareness of the function of experimentation in producing evidence to evaluate hypotheses.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0201_2,[framework] Sociocultural Theory;[framework] Vygotskian Theory;,,[method] Discourse Analysis;,[setting] language minority classrooms;[subject] science;,epistemology;equity;mastery orientation;participation;,,,

It proposes some rather stringent standards for novel methods, standards concerned with issues of validity, reliability, and the communication of methods and data. The discussion is illustrated by the detailed examination of two case studies that employ two different grain sizes of analysis—the first macroscopic, the second microscopic. In the light of those case studies, theoretical issues regarding the relationships among theory-based, method-based, and problem-based approaches to programmatic research in the learning sciences are considered.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0202_3,[framework] Cognitive Theory;,,[method] Case Study Research;[method] Video Analysis;,[subject] mathematics;,memory;metacognition;relationship;,,,
Misconceptions Reconceived: A Constructivist Analysis of Knowledge in Transition,Smith III et al.,1994,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article uses a critical evaluation of research on student misconceptions in science and mathematics to articulate a constructivist view of learning in which student conceptions play productive roles in the acquisition of expertise. We acknowledge and build on the empirical results of misconceptions research but question accompanying views of the character, origins, and growth of students' conceptions. Students have often been viewed as holding flawed ideas that are strongly held, that interfere with learning, and that instruction must confront and replace. We argue that this view overemphasizes the discontinuity between students and expert scientists and mathematicians, making the acquisition of expertise difficult to conceptualize. It also conflicts with the basic premise of constructivism: that students build more advanced knowledge from prior understandings. Using case analyses, we dispute some commonly cited dimensions of discontinuity and identify important continuities that were previously ignored or underemphasized. We highlight elements of knowledge that serve both novices and experts, albeit in different contexts and under different conditions. We provide an initial sketch of a constructivist theory of learning that interprets students' prior conceptions as resources for cognitive growth within a complex systems view of knowledge. This theoretical perspective aims to characterize the interrelationships among diverse knowledge elements rather than identify particular flawed conceptions; it emphasizes knowledge refinement and reorganization, rather than replacement, as primary metaphors for learning; and it provides a framework for understanding misconceptions as both flawed and productive.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0302_1,[framework] Conceptual Ecology;[framework] Constructivism;[framework] Knowledge in Pieces;,,[method] Case Study Research;[method] Constructivism (Research Paradigm);[method] Discourse Analysis;[method] Coding and Categorization;,[subject] science;,conceptual understanding;,,,

Using Technology to Assist in Realizing Effective Learning and Instruction: A Principled Approach to the Use of Computers in Collaborative Learning,Koschmann et al.,1994,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article describes a principled approach to the design of computer-based tools for use in collaborative instruction. We argue that a project should progress through four steps: (a) making explicit the instructional requirements that serve as design goals for the project; (b) performing a detailed study of current educational practice with regard to these goals; (c) developing a specification based on the identified requirements/limitations of the instructional setting and the known capabilities of the technology; and (d) producing an implementation that allows for local adaptation to instructional practice. We propose six principles of effective learning and instruction, which we view to be the critical features of learning in complex and ill-structured fields. Next, a detailed case study is presented based on the preclinical training given to medical students in the first 2 years of medical school. The problems of providing adequate instruction in the preclinical years are described, as is an instructional method known as problem-based learning (PBL) that has been introduced to redress some of these problems. The product of this design process is a set of specifications for technical augmentations that we believe will serve not only the needs of PBL but also those of other methods of instruction that depend on collaborative, case-based, or student-centered learning.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0303_2,[framework] Cognitive Apprenticeship;[framework] Situated Learning;,[pedagogy] Computer-Supported Learning Environments;,[method] Design-Based Research (DBR);,[technology] computer-supported learning;,,,,

The conceptual bases of computer-supported intentional learning environments (CSILE) come from research on intentional learning, process aspects of expertise, and discourse in knowledge-building communities. These bases combine to support the following propositions: Schools need to be restructured as communities in which the construction of knowledge is supported as a collective goal, and the role of educational technology should be to replace classroom discourse patterns with those having more immediate and natural extensions to knowledge-building communities outside school walls. CSILE is described as a means for refraining classroom discourse to support knowledge building in ways extensible to out-of-school knowledgeadvancing enterprises.

An Investigation of Problem Framing and Solving in a Grade 8 Open-Inquiry Science Program,Roth & Bowen,1994,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This study of learning in a Grade 8 open-inquiry science classroom focuses on the situated nature of students' problem framing and solving as they engaged in field research and the solving of contextual word problems, which we constructed from the students' own inquiries. The data sources included videotaped lessons, audiotaped interviews, and teacher-student interactions, and the artifacts constructed by students and teacher-researchers in the course of the study. Our analyses document and discuss the enormous work done by students in constructing research problems and resolving these problems through engaging in field research. During field research, many local problems emerged, which students learned to resolve interactionally with their peers and the settings. The students' framing of problems for research and work in the field setting stood in sharp contrast to their work on teacher-constructed, contextual word problems. These differences led us to a critical analysis of traditional word problems. The students' achievements in each of these situations emerged out of their interactions within a classroom community that encouraged independence, collaboration, and negotiation of meaning, and with the physical setting. Students' achievements and learning were meaningful because they were indexed to, and situated in, the setting of the students' experience.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0302_2,[framework] Distributed Cognition;[framework] Situated Cognition;,[pedagogy] Collaborative Learning;[pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL);,[method] Discourse Analysis;,[population] middle school;[subject] science;,disruption;agency;,,,
Learning 'How' Versus Learning 'When': Improving Transfer of Problem-Solving Principles,VanderStoep & Seifert,1994,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"How can problem solving be improved in domains where similar principles are learned? Aseries of three experimentsbased on Ross (1987) examinedhow instructing learners about when to apply problem-solving principles may later improve performance. In Experiment 1, subjects studied a similar pair (combinations and permutations)or a distinct pair (ambinations and conditionalprobability)of probability principles. Half of the subjects received information on when to apply the principles (applicability-instructions condition), whereas other subjects received instructionsthat reviewed how to solve problems using the principles (procedural-review condition). Subjects who received applicabilityinstructionsmade fewer confusion errors than subjects who received procedural-review instructionswhen learning the similar problem pair. However, this instructionalmanipulation had no effect when subjects were learning the distinct problem pair. Because applicability instructions affect confusion errors but not ovemll performance, they may improve the ability to identify when to apply a procedurebut may not improve memory for the formula or the ability to instantiate it. Experiment 2 supported this notion by showing that subjects given applicability instructions did better at selecting when to use each formula. Experiment 3 tested whethergivinglearnersthe pairs of examples to review together afforded them the opportunity to learn the applicability conditions on their own. The results showed that the important differencesbetween the principles (is., why the formulas apply in certain situations) must be identified in the instructional material because subjects were not likely to induce the differenceson their own. The results showed that when differencesbetween the related principles are identified in instructional material (is., why the formula applies in certain problems), these applicability instructionsmay serve to reduce confusionin noticing and selecting the relevant principle.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0301_3,[framework] Cognitive Skill Acquisition Theory;,,[method] Experimental Design;,,,,,

We describe a software architecture called Guided Social Simulation (GuSS). GuSS combines a simulation in which students can practice social skills with guidance that enhances the simulated experience. One of the applications of GuSS, called YELLO, teaches how to sell Yellow Pages advertising. YELLO is described in detail. The social simulation and guidance components of GuSS each present a set of technical and theoretical challenges. We discuss both sets. In discussing the techniques we use for constructing a social simulation, we emphasize the mechanisms that implement social agents as simple social planners. We then focus on one particular guidance component of GuSS—the storyteller. The storyteller is a teaching module that contains the real-life stories of experienced practitioners captured on videodisk.

In this article, we propose a structure and a set of design criteria for learn-by-doing environments that enable students to work towards desired goals. A key issue we address is the content to be taught by GBSs. Because skills are the form of knowledge that, when applied, enable students to achieve valued goals, we argue that GBSs should be designed to teach a set of target skills required to achieve a specified goal.

Biology Diagrams: Tools to Think With,Kindfield,1994,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"In an effort to characterize critical components of conceptual understanding in the domain of biology, particularly those that may be important to the design of biology instruction, I have been conducting research on individuals' understanding of and reasoning about subcellular biological processes. In this article I report the results of videotaped individual think-aloud interview sessions with is participants who varied in their degree of formal training in genetics that focused on the spontaneous generation and use of domain-specific diagrams during reasoning about the process of meiosis. The more advanced of the 15 participants displayed knowledge-dependent representational variability, fine-tuned their diagrams to the immediate reasoning task, and systematically used their fine-tuned diagrams as ""tools to think with"" while reasoning. These results suggest that more advanced pictorial skills and conceptual knowledge coevolve or mutually influence one another in the development of understanding of a subcellular biological process. Major implications of this research arc twofold. With regard to biology education, the results support and provide guidelines for the design of instruction that explicitly deals with the development of currently neglected pictorial skills. In a broader scope, these results provide a detailed empirical account of the role played by diagrams in scientific reasoning.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0301_1,[framework] Cognitive Task Analysis;,,[method] Cognitive Task Analysis;[method] Interview Methods;[method] Video Analysis;,[setting] higher education;[subject] biology;[technology] data visualization tools;[technology] virtual laboratories;,conceptual understanding;,,,
Students' Understanding of the Objectives and Procedures of Experimentation in the Science Classroom,Schauble et al.,1995,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"As part of a project to identify opportunities for reasoning that occur in good but typical science classrooms, this study focuses on how sixth graders reason about the goals and strategies of experimentation and laboratory activities in school. Collaborating with teachers, we explore whether reasoning can be deepened by developing instruction that capitalizes more effectively on the classroom opportunities that arise for fostering complex thinking and understanding. The design of the study includes (a) a baseline interview probing students' understanding of experimentation in the context of a standard, 40-min ""hands-on"" activity that is part of the standard sixth-grade curriculum; (b) a 3-week teaching study, in which five teachers, informed by the cognitive science research concerning the development of scientific reasoning, designed and taught a special experimentation unit in their classrooms; and (c) a series of follow-up interviews, in which students' understanding of experimentation was reexamined. The findings from the two learning contexts-one more supportive of student reasoning than the other-inform us about the kinds of reasoning that are developing in middle-school students and the forms of instruction best suited to exercising those developing skills.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0402_1,[framework] Developmental Psychology;,[pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL);,[method] Discourse Analysis;[method] Hypothesis Testing;[method] Longitudinal Study;,[population] elementary education;[setting] science classrooms;,epistemic justice;scaffolding;,,,
Modeling Individual Differences in Students' Learning Strategies,Recker & Pirolli,1995,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Learners employ a wide variety of strategies when faced with learning and problem solving in a new domain. The focus of this research is on learners' strategies when studying and explaining instructional materials to themselves prior to problem solving. In the first part of the article, we present results from an empirical study in which the learning and self-explanation strategies of subjects studying instructions embedded in a hypertext environment were contrasted with those from subjects learning with more standard, linear instruction. In the hypertext environment, instruction could be browsed in a nonlinear fashion, and the instructional examples were annotated with explanatory elaborations that students could choose to view. We present a Soar computational model that accounts for results from the study. A particular emphasis of the model was on capturing strategy differences between individual subjects. The general modeling approach involved coupling a model of individual subjects' interaction strategies with opportunities for action supported by the interfaces of the instructional environments. Specifically, by setting parameters, the model was fit to individual subject data. Analyses of subjects' simulations contribute several new results for understanding individual differences in strategy use and their role in learning. We show that clusters of subjects identified through analyses of model parameters continued to exhibit similar behaviors during subsequent problem solving, suggesting that the clusters corresponded to genuine strategy classes. Furthermore, these clusters appeared to represent general strategies that were, in some sense, adaptive to the task.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0401_1,[framework] ACT* Theory of Cognition;[framework] Cognitive Modeling;,,[method] Computational Modeling;,[setting] higher education;[technology] computational modeling;[technology] computer-based instruction;[technology] online forums;,memory;metacognition;,,,
The VCR Tutor: Effective Instruction for Device Operation,Mark & Greer,1995,Journal of the Learning Sciences,A critical issue for intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) is whether knowledgeable diagnosis and feedback offers instructional benefits compared with less knowledge-intensive instructional methods. The effectiveness of different instructional methods is examined in a device operation task: setting a VCR to record a program. Four tutoring simulations use different instructional approaches emphasizing specific types of knowledge. The possibility of acquiring this knowledge is manipulated by increasing opportunities to interact with the simulation and by explicitly providing knowledgeable diagnosis and feedback. Eighty novice adults were randomly assigned to the four tutors for training. Planned comparisons of learner achievement indicate greater learning with knowledgeable diagnosis and feedback compared to correctness feedback. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) to detect predicted linear trends shows increased instructional effectiveness across versions. Results are not simply a function of differences in training time. They support the contention that knowledgeable diagnosis and feedback can offer benefits over other instructional methods.,http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0402_3,[framework] Feedback Theory;,,[method] Experimental Design;,[population] adult learners;[technology] human–computer interaction;[technology] hypermedia;,,,,

The Emergence of Abstract Representations in Dyad Problem Solving,Schwartz,1995,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Three experiments examined whether group cognitions generate a product that is not easily ascribed to the cognitions that similar individuals have working alone. In each study, secondary-school students solved novel problems working either as individuals or in two-person groups called dyads. An examination of their problem-solving representations demonstrated that the dyads constructed abstractions well above the rate one would expect given a ""most competent member"" model of group performance applied to the empirical rate of individual abstractions. In the first experiment, dyads induced a numerical parity rule for determining the motions of linked gears four times more often than individuals, who instead tended to rely exclusively on modeling the gears' physical behaviors. In a second experiment requiring the construction of visualizations on the topic of biological transmissions, dyads made abstract visualizations (e.g., directed graphs) significantly more often than individuals. In a third experiment requiring a visualization of organisms and their habitat requirements, dyads made abstract visualizations (e.g., matrices) five times more often than individuals, who instead tended to draw pictures. These results are striking because a long history of experimentation has found little evidence that group performances can match the performances of the most competent individuals, let alone exceed them. The extremely high frequency of abstract representations among dyads suggests that the abstract representations emerged from collaborative cognitions not normally available to isolated individuals. The results are interpreted to be a natural result of the collaborative task demand of creating a common ground. To facilitate discourse, dyads negotiated a common representation that could serve as a touchstone for coordinating the members' different perspectives on the problem. Because the representation bridged multiple perspectives of the problem structure, it tended...",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0403_3,[framework] Constructivism;[framework] Distributed Cognition;,[pedagogy] Collaborative Learning;,[method] Constructivism (Research Paradigm);[method] Microgenetic Method;[method] Video Analysis;,,collaboration;coordination;disruption;agency;wonder;,,,

Moving Up and Getting Steeper: Negotiating Shared Descriptions of Linear Graphs,Moschkovich,1996,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This study examines mathematics learning in the context of peer discussions by focusing on students' descriptions of lines graphed on a computer screen. The article describes how these discussions provided a rich context for negotiating shared descriptions, supported conceptual change, and resulted in convergent meanings through reciprocal elaborations and clarifications. The participants in the study used graphing software to explore the connections between linear equations and their graphs with a peer. The article presents the analysis of three case studies examining how students negotiated shared descriptions of lines. These conversations supported students' construction of shared descriptions, but not necessarily by presenting conflicting ideas or through one student guiding another. Rather, negotiation functioned through local conversational resources such as the use of reference objects, spatial metaphors, and coordinated gestures and talk. These case studies also point to an important role for instruction in orchestrating and supporting peer discussions by modeling how to resolve negotiations and maintaining students' focus on mathematically productive learning trajectories.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0503_4,,,[method] Case Study Research;[method] Participant Observation;,[setting] higher education;[subject] mathematics;,conceptual understanding;negotiation;,,,

Discourse Generation for Instructional Applications: Identifying and Exploiting Relevant Prior Explanations,Moore et al.,1996,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"To reap the benefits of natural language interaction, tutorial systems must be endowed with the properties that make human natural-language interaction so effective. One striking feature of naturally occurring interactions is that human tutors and students freely refer to the context created by prior explanations. In contrast, computer-generated utterances that do not draw on the previous discourse often seem awkward and unnatural and may even be incoherent. The explanations produced by such systems are frustrating to students because they repeat the same information over and over again. Perhaps more critical is that, by not referring to prior explanations, computer-based tutors are not pointing out similarities between problem-solving situations and therefore may be missing out on opportunities to help students form generalizations. In this article, we discuss several observations from an analysis of human-human tutorial interactions and provide examples of the ways in which tutors and students refer to previous explanations. We describe how we have used a case-based reasoning algorithm to enable a computational system to identify prior explanations that may be relevant to the explanation currently being generated. We then describe two computational systems that can exploit this knowledge about relevant prior explanations in constructing their subsequent explanations.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0501_3,[framework] Case-Based Reasoning;,[pedagogy] Case-Based Reasoning;,[method] Computational Modeling;[method] Discourse Analysis;,[technology] computational modeling;[technology] computer-based instruction;[technology] hypermedia;[technology] mixed reality;,,,,

Art and Artifact of Children's Designing: A Situated Cognition Perspective,Roth,1996,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The purpose of this study was to investigate knowing and learning in an engineering design environment within an elementary classroom. Based on extensive ethnographic observation, video recordings, interviews with participants and observers, and children's design artifacts and engineering logbooks, fourth- and fifth-grade students' designing activities were interpreted from the perspective of situated cognition. The results show that children's designing was related to the artifacts, tools, materials, teacher-set constraints, and current trends in the setting. However, these elements cannot be taken as having some absolute ontology but are interpretively flexible. In the course of the engineering unit, the fourth- and fifth-grade students learned to exploit this interpretive flexibility to frame and solve problems. The emerging artifacts had at least two important functions: They were resources that structured the design process by both opening up possibilities and providing constraints, and they served to coordinate discursive and practical actions. The findings have important implications for affordances and constraints of learning environments in which designing is both a goal and a vehicle of instruction and for the evaluation of students' activities in such settings.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0502_2,[framework] Activity Theory;[framework] Distributed Cognition;[framework] Situated Cognition;,[pedagogy] Design-Based Learning (DBL);,[method] Design-Based Research (DBR);[method] Discourse Analysis;,[population] elementary education;,disruption;agency;,,,

To that end the nature of the interaction among four girls in a small group science activity is analyzed with respect to the other work on both girls' talk and on small group interactions. It is shown that three participants obtained very different access to this conversation from their usual access to whole class lessons. It is further shown that the student whose participation in the small group differed most from that of the others had a different orientation to the task and indicated she was playing by different conversational rules. Co-construction is then explored as a major means of interaction for the other three participants, but the question posed is to what extent this form is necessarily collaborative.

Individual Differences in Patterns of Spontaneous Online Tool Use,Shute & Gluck,1996,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"More than 400 individuals participated in an experiment involving two versions of a computer-based tutor teaching principles of electricity. We examined the relations among elective tool use, learning environment, outcome, and efficiency. We also tested the influence of both individual differences and learning environment on tool-usage behavior. The data showed no differences between the two learning environments (rule application vs. rule induction) with regard to outcome performance or learning efficiency. In addition, neither environment significantly influenced overall tool use. There was a main effect of tool use on learning outcome, but not on learning time. We categorized learners into four groups, based on tool-usage patterns and found that (a) people tended to show stable patterns across time and (b) that patterns differed significantly in terms of learning outcome—it was most effective to use the online tools earlier in the learning process rather than later. In terms of individual differences, we identified the characteristics of learners who evidenced different tool-usage patterns. They varied according to cognitive ability, domain-related interest, and gender. We propose a causal model that takes into account all of these data sources in predicting posttest performance. The article concludes with implications of these findings for those interested in maximizing instructional effectiveness, as well as suggestions for future research directions.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0504_2,[framework] Cognitive Apprenticeship;,,,[population] adult learners;[technology] computer-based instruction;,metacognition;,,,

Representation as Shared Activity: Situated Cognition and Dewey's Cartography of Experience,Hall,1996,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Dewey described the continuity of experience and the interaction of individuals with their environments as longitude and latitude for locating educative experience. This article examines three aspects of Dewey's Pragmatist philosophy as intellectual roots for current work in situated cognition. These aspects are used to organize a case analysis of two teachers working together to solve and design instruction for a typical algebra problem. The analysis focuses on interactional phenomena and argues that these phenomena are usually left out of studies of cognition and that they are critically important for understanding effective teaching. A close analysis of interaction supports a view of representation as shared activity, as an alternative to traditional cognitive accounts that focus exclusively on an individual's mental structures. In the moment-to-moment production and explanation of inferences about the mathematical structure of a problem, representations are activities in which these teachers are jointly engaged, rather than things that they individually have. Interpreting representation as a shared activity extends Dewey's cartography as a basis for studying mathematical experience and teaching.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0503_3,[framework] Deweyan Pragmatism / Deweyan Philosophy;[framework] Situated Cognition;,[pedagogy] Collaborative Learning;[pedagogy] Experience-Based Learning;,[method] Discourse Analysis;,,wonder;,,,

The Role of Extreme Case Reasoning in Instruction for Conceptual Change,Zietsman & Clement,1997,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Although it is common to see extreme case reasoning included in lists of expert heuristics for problem solving, little work has been reported on the role that extreme cases can play in learning that leads to conceptual change. Evidence is presented from video tapes of think-aloud tutoring sessions to document the learning from extreme cases in a unit about levers for seventh graders. The observations support the view that one role of extreme cases is to provide a firm data point or comparison that helps students to establish an ordinal relation between two given variables. Two new additional roles for extreme cases in fostering learning are also identified: (a) their role in activating an intuition, often in the form of a perceptual motor schema, that is used in constructing an imageable, intuitively, grounded, explanatory model as opposed to an empirical role; and (b) their role in facilitating the formation of new causal variables. Pending confirmation of similar effects in other subject areas, these roles are candidates for being included in a set of general learning strategies for science instruction. This illustrates the function that ""learning-aloud"" studies can play in documenting new types of learning processes and instructional strategies. The study highlights the importance for instructional design of research that uncovers students' existing knowledge structures and natural reasoning processes. The study suggests that explanatory model construction, causal relation construction, and concept formation can result from such instructional designs. The extent to which these three outcomes are evidence for strong conceptual change is also discussed.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0601_4,,,[method] Case Study Research;[method] Think-Aloud Protocols;[method] Transcript Analysis;[method] Video Analysis;,[population] middle school;[subject] physics;[subject] science;[technology] intelligent tutoring systems;,conceptual understanding;explanation;,,,
Conceptual Change and Wine Expertise,Solomon,1997,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Two studies explore conceptual change in the acquisition of wine expertise. In Experiment 1, tasters described a set of wines. Experts described the wines using more specific features than did intermediates, who, in turn, used more specific features than did novices. Specificity in describing wines was not related to discrimination performance on a psychophysical test. A regression analysis indicated that the features identified by the expert as well as those identified by the nonexpert tasters covaried with grape type, such that wines of the same grape were described more similarly than were wines of different grapes. In Experiment 2, the same tasters sorted the wines into clusters. Experts, unlike nonexperts, tended to sort the wines explicitly by grape type. Moreover, the features of the wines (described by the tasters in Experiment 1) covaried significantly better by the experts' clusters than they did by the nonexperts' clusters. Indeed, the features identified by the nonexperts covaried significantly worse when the wines were clustered by their own sortings than they did when the wines were clustered by actual grape type. It is suggested that the acquisition of wine expertise, a domain that is at once conceptual and perceptual, entails not only a greater differentiation of features but also a restructuring of the explicit schemes of classification.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0601_3,[framework] Cognitive Psychology;,,[method] Case Study Research;,,conceptual understanding;diversity;perception;,,,

Extracts from 3 conversations (of many, spanning 5 months) between 1 teacher and the mentor illustrate this teacher's changing ideas and the mentor's role.

Twenty 7th-grade students were given pre- and postinterviews that probed their understanding of 3 intensive and extensive quantity pairs (dot crowdedness and total dots; sweetness and total sugar; density and total weight) and their ability to use the former quantities to model the quantities of the latter two domains. The 2-week curriculum intervention focused on using an integrated dots-per-box model to represent various everyday quantities like sweetness of Kool-Aid. Prior to instruction there were disparities in student understanding of the 3 domains, and few students could make relevant mappings between the quantities in the model and the domains of sweetness and density. Instruction led to improvement in student differentiation and modeling of sweetness, a quantity directly considered in instruction. There was no change in student differentiation of density, a quantity not considered in instruction, although some students improved in their modeling of density. These findings are interpreted as showing that conceptual bootstrapping involves a multistepped mapping process that is facilitated through classroom dialogue, problem solving, and instruction.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0602_1,[framework] Cognitive Theory;,,[method] Experimental Design;,[technology] video analysis;,conceptual understanding;,,,

Microgenetic Analysis of Group-Based Solution of Complex Two-Step Mathematical World Problems by Fourth Graders,Taylor & Cox,1997,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"A form of socially assisted group learning based on a modified version of reciprocal teaching for mathematics (Campione, Brown, & Connell, 1988) was evaluated in terms of its effectiveness in promoting fourth graders' solution of complex 2-step word problems. The emphasis in this method is for an adult tutor to elicit solution suggestions from students and to explore the multiple solutions in seeking group agreement. The method focuses attention both on world representations underlying numbers and on transfer of problem solution planning skills to children over time. The results were compared with those from a modeling-reinforcement tutoring control condition and a classroom activity control in a 10-week study of fourth graders' solution of 4 types of 2-step math word problems, constructed to avoid keywords. Individuals who received either type of training earned higher scores for all problem types than did controls on quizzes; children in the modified reciprocal teaching condition outscored those in the modeling condition on problems that required information to be added from outside the problem and on a quiz of mixed problem types. Subsequent analysis of solutions and videotaped math behaviors suggested that those in the socially assisted learning condition used labeled representations in problem solving more effectively and deduced implied information earlier and more often than those in the modeling condition.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0602_2,[framework] Distributed Cognition;[framework] Social Constructivism;,[pedagogy] Collaborative Learning;,[method] Discourse Analysis;[method] Video Study;,[population] elementary education;[subject] mathematics;,collaboration;disruption;agency;interaction;memory;metacognition;problem solving;,,,
Dynamic Science Assessment: A New Approach for Investigating Conceptual Change,Magnusson et al.,1997,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Starting from the premise that understanding conceptual change requires studying it while it occurs, this article describes a new research methodology in which students' knowledge is assessed in the context of mediated learning situations that attempt to foster conceptual change. The methodology builds on two ideas: that conceptual change in science is a matter of appropriation by individuals of culturally based knowledge (of the scientific community), and that understanding such change requires a mediated context in which the students' activity (actions and thinking) is shaped by a more experienced other who reflects the cultural norms or ideals of the scientific community that facilitate knowledge production. Specific assessments developed with these ideas in mind, which we call dynamic science assessments (DSAs), function to determine students' potential to change their understanding and as a result inform us about the process of conceptual change toward scientific knowledge. Results of a DSA about electricity that we conducted with upper elementary school children (n = 28) indicated that it was possible to foster conceptual change and to discriminate children with respect to their potential to develop scientifically accurate conceptions of current and resistance. These findings indicate the promise of using mediated learning situations, such as a DSA to study conceptual change in science, and we discuss the direction of future work given the conservative mediation in the assessments conducted in this particular instance.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0601_5,,,,[population] middle school;[subject] science;,conceptual understanding;safety;,,,
Quantifying Qualitative Analyses of Verbal Data: A Practical Guide,Chi,1997,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article provides one example of a method of analyzing qualitative data in an objective and quantifiable way. Although the application of the method is illustrated in the context of verbal data such as explanations, interviews, problem-solving protocols, and retrospective reports, in principle, the mechanics of the method can be adapted for coding other types of qualitative data, such as gestures and videotapes. The mechanics of the method are outlined in 8 concrete steps. Although verbal analyses can be used for many purposes, the main goal of the analyses discussed here is to formulate an understanding of the representation of the knowledge used in cognitive performances and how that representation changes with learning. This can be contrasted with another method of analyzing verbal protocols, the goal of which is to validate the cognitive processes of human performance, often as embodied in a computational model.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0603_1,[framework] Grounded Theory;,,[method] Coding and Categorization;[method] Grounded Theory;[method] Protocol Analysis;,[technology] data science tools;,,,,

Middle school students’ initial attempts at inquiry in project-based science classrooms,Krajcik et al.,1998,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Although inquiry is an essential component of science learning, we know little about students' experience with inquiry in regular science classrooms. Our goal is to describe realistically what middle school students do and where they have difficulties in their first encounters with inquiry learning. We report findings from case studies of 8 students as they designed and carried out their own investigations during 2 projects that spanned several months. We detail how students asked questions, planned and designed investigations and procedures, constructed apparatus, carried out their work, interpreted data and drew conclusions, and presented the findings. We discuss how collaboration among group members and support from the teacher influenced this process. The findings indicate that middle school students were thoughtful in designing investigations and in planning procedures; for instance, they thought about controls, about samples, and about how to organize data collection. However, the cases also reveal areas of weakness, such as failures to focus on the scientific merit of questions generated and to systematically collect and analyze data and draw conclusions. Teacher structuring and questioning were crucial in encouraging students to be thoughtful about the substantive aspects of inquiry. Overall, these findings can help curriculum developers and science educators in their attempts to design instruction to improve the inquiry process.",https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315799285-3/inquiry-project-based-science-classrooms-initial-attempts-middle-school-students-joseph-krajcik-phyllis-blumenfeld-ronald-marx-kristin-bass-jennifer-fredricks-elliot-soloway,,,[method] Case Study Research;,[subject] science;,,,,
Authoring Tools for Component-Based Learning Environments,Ritter & Blessing,1998,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"We argue that a focus on building an authoring tool for a complete learning environment is misplaced. An analysis of the task of authoring a commercial educational system reveals it to be best accomplished through authoring separate components. For many of these components, authoring tools already exist and need not be duplicated for use in educational systems. Connecting the various components together is a separate authoring task, and parts of this task are different for educational systems than for typical component-based software. The second half of this article describes the Visual Translator, an authoring tool we have written specifically for this purpose.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0701_4,,,,[technology] hypermedia;,,,,

Resources for Refining Mathematical Conceptions: Case Studies in Learning About Linear Functions,Moschkovich,1998,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"In this article, I describe the refinement of a conception in the domain of linear functions, the use of the x-intercept in equations of the form y = mx + b, to illustrate the resources used by students to refine a conception. The examples presented show how students refined their use of the x-intercept by (a) narrowing the problem contexts in which they applied this conception, (b) making connections between conceptions, (c) using a mathematical procedure, and (d) refining their verbal descriptions of how the graph of a line changes as a result of a change in the equation. The analysis draws on diSessa's (1993) theory of science learning and the recommendations made by Smith, diSessa, and Roschelle (1993) for describing conceptual change. The results extend this prior work from science to mathematics and identify resources used by students that teachers can draw on to support the learning of mathematical concepts.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0702_3,[framework] Situated Cognition;[framework] Sociocultural Theory;,,[method] Case Study Research;[method] Discourse Analysis;[method] Video Analysis;,[population] high school;[subject] mathematics;,,,,
Diving Into Complexity: Developing Probabilistic Decentralized Thinking Through Role-Playing Activities,Resnick & Wilensky,1998,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"There is a growing interest in role-playing activities, both in school classrooms and in the culture at large. Despite this growing interest, role-playing activities are rare in mathematics and science classrooms. In social-studies activities, a major goal is to help students adopt the perspective of another person. However, mathematics and science classes typically discourage this type of perspective-taking; science is usually taught as a process of detached observation and analysis of phenomena, not active participation within phenomena. In this article, we argue that role-playing activities can play a powerful role in mathematics and science education—particularly in the study of the new sciences of complexity. We present detailed descriptions and analyses of 2 role-playing activities that we have organized. Each activity is designed to help students explore (in a very participatory way) the behaviors of complex systems, helping them develop better intuitions on how complex phenomena can arise from simple interactions, and predictable patterns from random events.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0702_1,[framework] Complex Systems Theory;[framework] Constructionism;[framework] Design-Based Research (DBR);,[pedagogy] Constructionism;[pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR);[pedagogy] Participatory Design;,[method] Design-Based Research (DBR);,[population] middle school;[subject] mathematics;[subject] science;[technology] computer-based modeling;,,,,

Reflective Teaching of Logo,Lehrer et al.,1999,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"A long-term instructional experiment assessed the cognitive consequences of reflective teaching practices, compared to inquiry teaching practices, on the acquisition and transfer of Logo computer programming for 2nd- and 5th-grade students. Inquiry teaching represented previous ""best practices"" in which teachers elicited predictions, asked leading questions, and assisted students when they encountered programming impasses. Reflective teaching modified inquiry teaching by explicit encouragement of a design stance where students assumed roles as potential designers of Logo as well as actual roles as the designers of their own programs for peer audiences. Other tools for reflection included writing summaries of their programming experiences, using programming templates, and working with ""microworlds"" that helped students objectify their experiences with Logo. Multiple levels (syntactic, semantic, schematic, strategic, and beliefs) of Logo knowledge were measured during and after instruction. Between-group differences over repeated measures consistently favored the group participating in reflective instruction. However, rather than simple differences on every measure, the pattern of mean differences over time was most consistent with Mayer's (1985) proposal of a chain of cognitive consequences regulating the acquisition of Logo. Moreover, participation in the reflective context facilitated general transfer of specific skills like debugging and summarization for both grades, but no differences in general transfer were observed between instructional conditions for skills not explicitly targeted for instruction. Children participating in the reflective context developed beliefs about programming practices that were tightly coupled with their performances. This tight coupling underscores the reciprocal relation between the social and the individual in the acquisition and transfer of cognitive skill.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0802_3,[framework] Constructionism;[framework] Design-Based Research (DBR);,[pedagogy] Constructionism;[pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR);,[method] Case Study Research;[method] Design-Based Research (DBR);,[population] elementary education;[subject] mathematics;[subject] computer science / programming;[technology] computer-based instruction;,problem solving;reasoning;reflection;,,,

Learning to Relate Qualitative and Quantitative Problem Representations in a Model-Based Setting for Collaborative Problem Solving,Ploetzner et al.,1999,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"In an experimental study, we investigated how 10th graders acquire, extend, and successively relate knowledge about qualitative and quantitative aspects of classical mechanics. The study was made up of 2 main phases. In the 1st phase, students were taught either qualitative or quantitative aspects of classical mechanics by means of 2 different instructional units. In both units, concept maps were used for the presentation of information. In the 2nd phase, dyads were formed with students who worked on different instructional units and thus possessed systematically different knowledge. The 2 students collaboratively worked on problems that were beyond the competence of each of them and demanded the coordinated useof knowledge about qualitative and quantitative aspects. Before and after the instruction as well as after the collaborative problem solving, students had to work on multicomponent tests. In addition, during the collaborative problem solving, protocols were taken of the students' mutual exchange of information An analysis of the multicomponent tests revealed that qualitative as well as quantitative knowledge can successfully be taught by means of concept maps. Students who initially were taught qualitative aspects of physics gained significantly more from the information provided by their quantitatively instructed partners during the collaborative problem solving than the other way around. An analysis of individual problem-solving attempts uncovered that students learned to construct increasingly more complete qualitative and quantitative problem representations. An explorative protocol analysis of the students' dialogues further indicated that the students gradually shifted their focus from quantitative to qualitative problem representations during collaborative problem solving.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0802_1,[framework] Cognitive Apprenticeship;,[pedagogy] Collaborative Learning;,[method] Experimental Design;,[setting] higher education;[subject] physics;[subject] science;[technology] computer-based instruction;,collaboration;wonder;,,,
The Relevance of Hierarchies to Learning Biology From Hypertext,Shapiro,1999,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Previous research on text-based learning has shown the relevance of hierarchical structures to the acquisition of complex concepts and the formation of knowledge structures. Because of the inflexible nature of traditional text, however, these studies have been limited to comparing participants learning with either hierarchical or linear presentations. As a consequence, our understanding of the importance of hierarchies to information processing is only relative to that of linear text. The purpose of this investigation is to move beyond that comparison, to explore more deeply the relevance of hierarchies to information processing. For this study, the traits that characterize a hierarchy were isolated and used in varying combinations to create 4 different organizations for a single body of information: hierarchical, clustered, unstructured, and linear. The creation of these structures was made possible by hypertext technology. Participants were each assigned to study one of these systems and were then asked to take cued-association, problem-solving, and factual-knowledge posttests. Results of these tests suggest that participants in all conditions created hierarchical representations as they worked and that those in the nonlinear conditions used this structure to guide their exploration of the material. They also suggest that an important function of hierarchies may be to define relations between concepts. Results are discussed in relation to current theories of learning, the construction of knowledge structures, and application to educational settings.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0802_2,[framework] Cognitive Theory;[framework] Schema Theory;,,[method] Design-Based Research (DBR);[method] Experimental Design;,[setting] higher education;[subject] biology;[technology] computer-based instruction;,conceptual understanding;,,,

Rule-Learning Events in the Acquisition of a Complex Skill: An Evaluation of Cascade,VanLehn,1999,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Acquiring a complex cognitive skill often involves learning principles of the task domain in the midst of solving problems or studying examples. Cascade is a model of such learning. It includes both rule-based reasoning and several kinds of analogical, case-based reasoning. Task domain principles are represented as rules, and Cascade learns new rules at rule-learningevents, which are initiated by an impasse and utilize multiple kinds of reasoning. In this article, I evaluate Cascade's model of rule-learning events by analyzing ones gleaned from protocols of physics students solving problems and studying examples. As expected, Cascade's model is overly simple, but it appears feasible to extend it to cover all the observed learning events. The data themselves were surprising in that there are few learning events relative to the number that could have occurred, and those that did occur often involved forms of reasoning that are considerably shallower than expected. The data suggest ways that instruction can be improved to increase both the quantity and depth of learning events.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0801_3,[framework] Cognitive Modeling;[framework] Cognitive Skill Acquisition Theory;,,[method] Protocol Analysis;,[setting] higher education;[subject] physics;[subject] science;,memory;metacognition;problem solving;,,,

"Differential Participation During Science Conversations: The Interaction of Focal Artifacts, Social Configurations, and Physical Arrangements",Roth et al.,1999,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Recent conceptualizations of knowing and learning focus on the degree of participation in the practices of communities. Discursive practices are the most important and characteristic practices in many communities. This study was designed to investigate how the content and form of classroom discourse was influenced by different combinations of artifacts (e.g., overhead transparencies, physical models), social configurations, and physical arrangements. Over a 4-month period, we collected data (video-taped activities, interviews, ethnographic observations, artifacts, and photographs) in a Grade 6-7 science class studying a unit on simple machines. Four different activity structures differed in terms of the social configuration (whole class, small group) and the origin of the central, activity-organizing artifact (teacher designed, student designed). This study describes how different artifacts, social configurations, and physical arrangements led to different interactional spaces, participant roles, and levels of participation in classroom conversations and, concomitantly, to different discursive forms and content. The artifacts had important functions in maintaining and sequencing conversations. Depending on the situation and the role of participants, artifacts served as resources for students' sense making. Each of the different activity structures supported different dimensions of participating in conversations and, for this reason, we conclude that science educators teaching large classes should employ a mixture of these activity structures. Overall, students developed considerable competencies in discursive and materials practices related to simple machines.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.1999.9672073,[framework] Activity Theory;[framework] Distributed Cognition;[framework] Embodied Knowing / Embodiment;[framework] Sociocultural Theory;,,[method] Discourse Analysis;[method] Video Analysis;,[population] elementary education;[subject] science;,disruption;agency;,,,

Divisions of Labor in School and in the Workplace: Comparing Computer and Paper-Supported Activities Across Settings,Stevens,2000,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This study uses the concept of division of labor to investigate the comparative uses of media in 2 organizational settings (a middle school classroom and a professional architecture firm). In both settings, participants used both computer and paper-based media in architectural project work. This study found that, in both settings, collaborative labor was divided between designers who worked on paper and draftspersons who worked with computers. The analysis compares the origins of these divisions of labor and finds important similarities in the reasons for the divisions of labor and important differences in the implications of the divisions of labor for participants. The analysis links the similarities to the comparative affordances of different media for supporting collaboration and links the differences to how the 2 environments differently evaluated its participants as individuals and as members of a group.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS0904_1,[framework] Activity Theory;[framework] Distributed Cognition;[framework] Situated Learning;,,[method] Comparative Analysis;,[technology] computer-supported learning;,collaboration;disruption;agency;,,,

Beyond Black Boxes: Bringing Transparency and Aesthetics Back to Scientific Investigation,Resnick et al.,2000,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"We present a set of case studies in which students create, customize, and personalize their own scientific instruments-and thus become engaged in scientific inquiry not only through observing and measuring but also through designing and building. Although computational technologies have, in general, contributed to making today's scientific instruments more ""opaque"" (that is, less understandable) and less aesthetically pleasing than their predecessors, we argue that these same technologies can be used to bring back a sense of transparency and aesthetics to the design of scientific instruments. We analyze how students, by building their own scientific instruments, can pursue a broader range of scientific investigations of their own choosing, feel a stronger sense of personal investment in their scientific investigations, and develop deeper critical capacities in evaluating scientific measurements and knowledge.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0901_3,[framework] Constructionism;[framework] Design-Based Research (DBR);,[pedagogy] Constructionism;[pedagogy] Design-Based Learning (DBL);[pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR);,[method] Computational Modeling;[method] Design-Based Research (DBR);,[population] middle school;[setting] informal learning;[subject] science;[technology] computational modeling;[technology] multimedia learning;[technology] simulations;,,,,
Science on the Web: Students Online in a Sixth-Grade Classroom,McCrory Wallace et al.,2000,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Publications from newspapers to research journals are filled with claims about the Internet and its value for education, yet research is just beginning to evaluate uses of these new information resources in the classroom. As part of the University of Michigan Digital Library Project, this research was undertaken as a first step in designing tools for secondary students to access a digital library. The Web offered an initial site for learning how students interact with digital resources and use standard tools. The Web can be seen as a site for student inquiry in science, using it as an information resource that opens the boundaries of the classroom and creates the possibility for students to pursue questions of personal interest. This study looks at students in 6th-grade science classes as they use the Web to carry out an inquiry-based assignment. Their understanding and enactment of their assignment to do research on the Web, their engagement in information seeking, and their use of Web technologies are explored and analyzed. Findings: include evidence that students use Web technologies easily but simplistically; that information seeking is a complex and difficult process for these students, who seek to reduce the task to finding an obvious answer or finding a good Web site; and that developing students' understanding of content through use of the Web is a challenge for students and teachers.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0901_5,[framework] Design-Based Research (DBR);[framework] Social Constructivism;,[pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR);[pedagogy] Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL);,[method] Ethnography;[method] Design-Based Research (DBR);,[population] middle school;[setting] online learning;[subject] science;[technology] MOOCs;[technology] virtual reality;,collaboration;,,,
The Design of Hypermedia Tools for Learning: Fostering Conceptual Change and Transfer of Complex Scientific Knowledge,Jacobson & Archodidou,2000,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"A central premise of this article is that hypermedia tools may be developed for case and problem-centered learning in order to achieve significant learning outcomes such as deep conceptual understanding, conceptual change, and knowledge transfer. An approach for developing hypermedia case and problem-centered knowledge resources is proposed-the knowledge mediator framework (KMF)-which consists of design elements and learning activities that have specific sociocognitive theoretical and research rationales. A proof-of-concept study is then discussed; it involved high school students using a hypermedia system based on the main features of the KMF to learn neo-Darwinian evolutionary biology. Students using the experimental hypermedia system were found to change their evolutionary biology problem-solving models, and to continue to use expert-like models even 1 year after using the system. The use of the KMF to develop hypermedia learning materials in other domains and for constructive student projects is also considered. Overall, it is hoped that the framework and research outlined in this article may contribute to design and pedagogical principles for hypermedia learning tools that help students construct rich and useful understandings of challenging knowledge.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0902_2,[framework] Case-Based Reasoning;[framework] Conceptual Change Theory;[framework] Constructivism;[framework] Design-Based Research (DBR);,[pedagogy] Case-Based Learning (CBL);[pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR);,[method] Constructivism (Research Paradigm);[method] Design-Based Research (DBR);[method] Experimental Design;[method] Knowledge Mediator Framework (KMF);,[population] high school;[subject] biology;[subject] science;,conceptual understanding;transfer;,,,

The Roles of Representations and Tools in the Chemistry Laboratory and Their Implications for Chemistry Learning,Kozma et al.,2000,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"In this historical and observational study, we describe how scientists use representations and tools in the chemistry laboratory, and we derive implications from these findings for the design of educational environments. In our observations we found that chemists use representations and tools to mediate between the physical substances that they study and the aperceptual chemical entities and processes that underlie and account for the material qualities of these physical substances. There are 2 important, interrelated aspects of this mediational process: the material and the social. The 1st emphasizes the surface features of both physical phenomena and symbolic representations, features that can be perceived and manipulated. The 2nd underscores the inherently semiotic, rhetorical process whereby chemists claim that representations stand for unseen entities and processes. In elaborating on our analyses, we � Examine the historical origins and contemporary practices of representation use in one particular domain-chemistry-to look at how developments in the design of representations advance the development of a scientific community, as well as the understanding of scientists engaged in laboratory practice. � Examine representations spontaneously generated by chemists, as well as those generated by their tools or instruments, and look at how scientists-individually and collaboratively-coordinate these 2 types of representations with the material substances of their investigations to understand the structures and processes that underlie them. � Draw implications from the study of scientists to make recommendations for the design of learning environments and symbol systems that can support the use of representations by students to understand the structures and processes that underlie their scientific investigations and to engage them in the practices of knowledge-building communities.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls0902_1,[framework] Constructivism;[framework] Situated Cognition;,,[method] Participant Observation;[method] Constructivism (Research Paradigm);[method] Discourse Analysis;,[population] high school;[subject] chemistry;[subject] science;[technology] data visualization tools;[technology] virtual laboratories;,wonder;representations;,,,

Affordances of Collaborative Software Design Planning for Elementary Students' Science Talk,Kafai & Ching,2001,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Although educational research and practice has found many benefits of long-term and complex design activities, an issue of growing concern is that students might lose sight of science learning while diverting their attention to design aesthetics, collaborative management, and technology. A question is whether or not science is actually separate from these aspects; it may be that science permeates the design environment and is thus contexted within these other activities. To investigate this possibility we followed a classroom of 33 students, divided into 7 teams, and we examined their science discussions as they planned for creating instructional software designs. Specifically, we investigated which conversational contexts gave rise to science talk. We found that a focus on the fine-grained details of the instructional science designs themselves and the contributions of more design-experienced students played an important role in the sophistication of the science content in the planning discussions. In examining less productive contexts for science talk, we found that a conversational focus in planning discussions on collaboration and software issues, as well as the science focus of the software designs, impacted the quality of science integration. In our discussion, we address the issue of which design contexts afford opportunities for richer discourse and the implications for other project-based design activities.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1003_4,[framework] Constructionism;[framework] Design-Based Research (DBR);[framework] Social Constructivism;,[pedagogy] Constructionism;[pedagogy] Design-Based Learning (DBL);[pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR);,[method] Collaborative Design Research;[method] Design-Based Research (DBR);[method] Discourse Analysis;,[population] elementary education;[subject] science;[technology] digital tools;[technology] sensor-based systems;,collaboration;,,,
Identity Construction Environments: Developing Personal and Moral Values Through the Design of a Virtual City,Umaschi Bers,2001,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"We live in a society where concepts of self, community, and ""what is right and wrong"" are constantly changing. This makes it particularly challenging for young people to construct a sense of self and to identify their most cherished values. Therefore, there is an amounting pressure in schools and society to create learning environments to explore these issues. Two research questions are at the heart of the work presented in this article: What kind of learning environment will afford opportunities for young people to naturally engage in reflection and discussion about issues of identity, in particular personal and moral values? and How can technologies have an impact on character and moral education? I propose identity construction environments (ICEs) as technological tools purposefully designed with the goal of supporting young people in the exploration of these issues. I first describe the design principles that distinguish these environments from other learning technologies. I also specify the learning experiences they do afford-namely the understanding of identity as a complex construction composed by different elements, including personal and moral values. Then I present the conceptual foundations and implementation of the Zora ICE. Zora is a three dimensional multi-user virtual environment that engages learners in the design of a graphical virtual city and its social organization. I describe a summer workshop conducted with a multicultural group of teenagers using Zora. They designed a virtual city populated with objects and characters representing aspects of themselves and their values. In this participatory microcommunity those values were put to test. Finally I conclude with reflections and future work that points toward a new research agenda in the area of the learning sciences.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1004new_1,[framework] Constructionism;[framework] Design-Based Research (DBR);[framework] Identity Theory;[framework] Moral Development;,[pedagogy] Constructionism;[pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR);,[method] Case Study Research;[method] Design-Based Research (DBR);,[population] elementary education;[setting] virtual worlds;[technology] digital tools;[technology] tangible computing;,identity;moral reasoning;narrative;,,,

Knowing When You've Brought Them in: Scientific Genre Knowledge and Communities of Practice,O'Neill,2001,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Increasingly, researchers in the learning sciences are appealing to notions of community to shape the design of learning technologies and curricular innovations. Many of these designs, including those in the area of project-based science, show strong promise; but, it is a challenging matter to understand the influences of these innovations in a detailed enough fashion to refine them over time. This work demands sensitive, theoretically grounded ways to assess the depth to which particular facets of innovations help enculturate students into communities of discourse and practice. Taking genre theory and the sociology of science as points of departure, I demonstrate a unique approach to the problems of developing and assessing students' understanding of persuasive practices in the scientific community. The research I discuss revolves around students' use of a professional scientific genre of scientific writing, the Research Article or Introduction, Methods, Results, Discission (IMRD) report (Swales, 1990), as they compose reports about their own original research. Using data from an innovative project-based high school science class, I demonstrate how genre use provides a window on the effectiveness of a learning environment in helping use discipline-specific tools of persuasion. In the classroom studied here, students developed e-mail mentoring relationships with volunteer scientists across the United States and Canada. Working in partnership with the teacher, these ""telementors"" served not only as inquiry guides for students, but also as a critical audience that helped shape the arguments they made about their research. Detailed analysis of the final reports produced by teams of students in the class revealed a significant relation between their fulfillment of the customary persuasive functions of a scientific research article and sustained correspondence with their telementors. A significant relation was also observed between sustained dialogue with telementors and careful hedging of knowledge claims. I situate these findings within a body of theory that suggests the value of telementoring relationships consists not only the ongoing advice and guidance they furnish, but in the ways that a professional audience shapes students' ideas about the sorts of arguments that are called for in science class. Because the analysis of genre use is a relatively noninvasive way to examine students' understandings of scientific persuasion (as compared with survey instruments or pull-out interviews), this method can serve as a useful tool for reformers wishing to compare the outcomes from iterations or conditions of design experiments that aim to develop students' understanding of persuasive practices in the scientific community. It may also make a useful transfer measure for a wide range of classroom innovations that aim to cultivate scientific reasoning and persuasion, such as science-oriented tools for computer-supported collaborative learning.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1003_1,[framework] Communities of Practice;[framework] Genre Theory;[framework] Sociocultural Theory;,[pedagogy] Communities of Practice;,[method] Case Study Research;[method] Discourse Analysis;,[subject] science;,communication;identity;participation;,,,
Situating Cognition,Roth,2001,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"In this article, I describe an epistemological framework and an associated research method. This framework focuses on the structural relations of individual and setting as experienced by the individual. Due to the fact that individuals may be perceptually attuned to phenomena at different ranges and time scales, researchers who want to understand cognition have to follow this changing field of attention. My analysis consists in zooming to identify patterns that simultaneously occur at multiple levels. Zooming, therefore, embodies a reflexive relation to different figure-ground relations in the attentional field of the individuals I study. To exemplify my approach to research, I use data from a physics classroom where students learn to explain computer-animated microworld events in terms of Newtonian theory.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS10-1-2_4,[framework] Distributed Cognition;[framework] Gestalt Theory;[framework] Situated Cognition;,,[method] Ethnography;[method] Video Study;,[population] high school;[subject] physics;[subject] science;,disruption;agency;perception;reflection;,,,
Learning by Analogical Bootstrapping,Kurtz et al.,2001,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Analogies are typically drawn from a well-understood situation to a situation that is poorly understood. In this research, we investigate a different route to analogical insight. We suggest that mutual alignment-that is, comparison between 2 partially understood situations-can act to promote comprehension and abstraction. We presented participants with 2 analogous scenarios depicting heat flow. They were given processing tasks that varied in the degree to which comparison was required. We then measured insight into the common structure in 3 ways. Participants were asked to (a) specify differences between the 2 pictured scenarios, (b) write scenario descriptions, and (c) rate the similarity of the 2 scenarios. The results show that carrying out comparison promotes greater insight into the common causal structure, but only when the comparison is intensive. The best results were obtained when participants were asked to jointly interpret the scenarios and to list specific correspondences. In a second experiment designed to further pinpoint the source of the comparison advantage, participants were asked to make correspondences between the elements of the 2 scenarios. These results suggest that mutual alignment is an effective means of promoting insight.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1004new_2,[framework] Cognitive Psychology;,,[method] Experimental Design;,[setting] higher education;,conceptual understanding;thinking;,,,

Locating an Ecological Psychology Methodology for Situated Action,Kulikowich & Young,2001,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"We attempt to describe what a methodology for situated action should do for students given problem solving in school settings. Working from an ecological account of perception-action, we propose that a methodology for understanding situated action should afford the instructional designer (often the classroom teacher), the methodologist, and the problem solver opportunities to co-construct coupling dynamics that operate on multiple space and time scales including ""real time."" With this goal in mind, we propose the use of the Jasper Planning Assistant (JPA), an online learning and assessment system that becomes part of the design-learning-research situation and serves as a scaffold for the learner. Through analysis of log-file data produced by the JPA, we illustrate that a methodology for situated action should be neither a purely quantitative nor qualitative account, but rather an inscription-an emergent visualization of the coupling dynamics between a student and his or her environment. We conclude that ideally this emergent inscription should reveal the multiple space times in which problem solving is occurring, yet be reductive in such a way as to create affordances for future action: Methodology should have functional value.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS10-1-2_7,[framework] Ecological Psychology;,,[method] Ecological Validity;,,domain knowledge;,,,

"The Problem of Transfer, and the Sociocultural Critique of Schooling",Packer,2001,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"It is often suggested that transfer is central to our system of education. Yet transfer has proven hard to define, difficult to investigate, and perplexingly controversial. This article compares 1 of the earliest critiques of transfer- Dewey's (1916)-with 1 of the most recent-Lave's (1988)-to explore how the debate over transfer is linked to competing views of the goals and aims of schooling. It is proposed that if sociocultural theory is to make good on its critique of schooling, it must be extended in 2 respects: in its ontology of the person, and its conception of the society in which we live. A preliminary sketch is provided of each of these extensions, to develop the sociocultural suggestion that learning and schooling both involve transformation of the person. The debate over transfer rests on but obscures divergent views of the goals and aims of schooling. Both critique of schooling and calls for school reform presuppose conceptions of the kind of person we want children to be, and the kind of society we wish to foster.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1004new_4,[framework] Critical Psychology;[framework] Deweyan Pragmatism / Deweyan Philosophy;[framework] Sociocultural Theory;,,,[setting] public schooling;,transfer;,,,

The Microevolution of Mathematical Knowledge: The Case of Randomness,Pratt & Noss,2002,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"In this article, we explore the growth of mathematical knowledge and in particular, seek to clarify the relation between abstraction and context. Our method is to gain a deeper appreciation of the process by which mathematical abstraction is achieved and the nature of abstraction itself, by connecting our analysis at the level of observation with a corresponding theoretical analysis at an appropriate grain size. In this article, we build on previous work to take a further step toward constructing a viable model of the microevolution of mathematical knowledge in context.The theoretical model elaborated here is grounded in data drawn from a study of 10 to 11 year olds' construction of meanings for randomness in the context of a carefully designed computational microworld, whose central feature was the visibility of its mechanisms-how the random behavior of objects actually ""worked."" In this article, we illustrate the theory by reference to a single case study chosen to illuminate the relation between the situation (including, crucially, its tools and tasks) and the emergence of new knowledge. Our explanation will employ the notion of situated abstraction as an explanatory device that attempts to synthesize existing micro- and macrolevel descriptions of knowledge construction. One implication will be that the apparent dichotomy between mathematical knowledge as decontextualized or highly situated can be usefully resolved as affording different perspectives on a broadening of contextual neighborhood over which a network of knowledge elements applies.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1104_2,[framework] Constructionism;[framework] Design-Based Research (DBR);,[pedagogy] Constructionism;[pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR);,[method] Design-Based Research (DBR);[method] Longitudinal Study;,[population] middle school;[subject] mathematics;[technology] computer-based instruction;,conceptual understanding;epistemic justice;,,,

Children's Developing Mathematics in Collective Practices: A Framework for Analysis,Saxe,2002,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article presents a cultural-developmental framework for the analysis of children's mathematics in collective practices and illustrates the heuristic value of the framework through the analysis of videotaped episodes drawn from a middle-school classroom. The framework is presented in 2 related parts. The first targets the children's emerging mathematical goals in collective practices, with a particular focus on the complex role that artifacts play in children's emerging goals. The second part focuses on children's developing mathematics that takes form in their goal-directed activities: (a) Microgenetic analyses concern the process whereby children structure cultural forms like artifacts to serve particular functions as they accomplish emerging mathematical goals; (b) sociogenetic analyses concern the spread or travel of mathematical forms and associated functions within a community of individuals; and (c) ontogenetic analyses concern the interplay between the forms that children use and the functions that they serve over the course of children's development. The analyses of the classroom episodes points to the promise (and limitations) of the framework as a method for furthering our understanding of the interplay between social and developmental processes in children's mathematics.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2002.9672140,[framework] Developmental Psychology;[framework] Sociocultural Theory;,[pedagogy] Collaborative Learning;,,[population] elementary education;[subject] mathematics;,participation;,,,

The Interplay of Intimations and Implementations: Generating New Discourse With New Symbolic Tools,Sfard,2002,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The analysis of the Batteries and AIDS episodes presented in this article is guided by the assumption that thinking can be conceptualized as an activity of communication, and learning can be regarded as modifying and extending one's discursive ways. Within this framework, 1 of the aims of mathematical learning is to become skillful in the discursive use of designated symbolic artifacts supposed to mediate solving certain types of problems. My analysis of the learning episodes is aimed at uncovering the ways in which the discursive uses of such new symbolic tools were interactively constructed by the students. I argue that the construction process is extremely complex because of a certain inherent circularity of this process. The analysis reveals that this difficulty may be overcome by the gradual dialectic adjustment of former discursive habits to new contexts. The adjustment happens gradually, through cycles of intimations about the applicability of the old habits followed by implementations in which this applicability is examined. This intricate interplay of intimations and implementations is found in both the Batteries and the AIDS episodes and is presented in detail in the article. I also show that, with time, students significantly increased their mastery of this particular discursive mechanism.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2002.9672142,[framework] Semiotic Mediation;[framework] Sociocultural Theory;,,[method] Discourse Analysis;,[subject] mathematics;,communication;conceptual understanding;dialogue;disagreement;mediation;,,,

Higher Order Thinking Skills and Low-Achieving Students: Are They Mutually Exclusive?,Zohar & Dori,2003,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Fostering students’ higher order thinking skills is considered an important educational goal. Although learning theories see the development of students’ thinking as an important goal for all students, teachers often believe that stimulating higher order thinking is appropriate only for high-achieving students. According to this view, low-achieving students are, by and large, unable to deal with tasks that require higher order thinking skills and should thus be spared the frustration generated by such tasks. Because this view may cause teachers to treat students in a nonegalitarian way, it is important to find out whether or not it is supported by empirical evidence. The goal of this study is to examine this issue in light of four different studies, by asking the following question: Do low-achieving students gain from teaching and learning processes that are designed to foster higher order thinking skills? Each of the4 studies addressed a different project whose goal was to teach higher order thinking in science classrooms. Following a brief general description of each project, we provide an analysis of its effects on students with low and high achievements. The findings show that by the end of each of the 4 programs, students with high academic achievements gained higher thinking scores than their peers with low academic achievements. However, students of both subgroups made considerable progress with respect to their initial score. In one of the 4 studies the net gain of low achievers was significantly higher than for high achievers. Our findings strongly suggest that teachers should encourage students of all academic levels to engage in tasks that involve higher order thinking skills.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1202_1,,,[method] Comparative Analysis;,[subject] science;,,,,

When Smart Groups Fail,Barron,2003,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"In this study I investigated how collaborative interactions influence problem-solving outcomes. Conversations of twelve 6th-grade triads were analyzed utilizing quantitative and qualitative methods. Neither prior achievement of group members nor the generation of correct ideas for solution could account for between-triad differences in problem-solving outcomes. Instead, both characteristics of proposals and partner responsiveness were important correlates of the uptake and documentation of correct ideas by the group. Less successful groups ignored or rejected correct proposals, whereas more successful groups discussed or accepted them. Conversations in less successful groups were relatively incoherent as measured by the extent that proposals for solutions in these groups were connected with preceding discussions. Performance differences observed in triads extended to subsequent problem-solving sessions during which all students solved the same kinds of problems independently. These findings suggest that the quality of interaction had implications for learning. Case study descriptions illustrate the interweaving of social and cognitive factors involved in establishing a joint problem-solving space. A dual-space model of what collaboration requires of participants is described to clarify how the content of the problem and the relational context are interdependent aspects of the collaborative situation. How participants manage these interacting spaces is critical to the outcome of their work and helps account for variability in collaborative outcomes. Directions for future research that may help teachers, students, and designers of educational environments learn to see and foster productive interactional practices are proposed.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1203_1,,,,,collaboration;communication;coordination;participation;,,,

Problem-Based Learning Meets Case-Based Reasoning in the Middle-School Science Classroom: Putting Learning by Design(tm) Into Practice,Kolodner et al.,2003,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article tells the story of the design of Learning by Design(tm) (LBD), a project-based inquiry approach to science learning with roots in case-based reasoning and problem-based learning, pointing out the theoretical contributions of both, classroom issues that arose upon piloting a first attempt, ways we addressed those challenges, lessons learned about promoting learning taking a project-based inquiry approach, and lessons learned about taking a theory-based approach to designing learning environments. LBD uses what we know about cognition to fashion a learning environment appropriate to deeply learning science concepts and skills and their applicability, in parallel with learning cognitive, social, learning, and communication skills. Our goal, in designing LBD, was to lay the foundation in middle school for students to be successful thinkers, learners, and decisionmakers throughout their lives and especially to help them begin to learn the science they need to know to thrive in the modern world. LBD has students learn science in the context of achieving design-and-build challenges. Included in LBD's framework is a set of ritualized and sequenced activities that help teachers and students acclimate to the culture of a highly collaborative, learner-centered, inquiry-oriented, and design-based classroom. Those ritualized activities help teachers and students learn the practices of scientists, engineers, and group members in ways that they can use outside the classroom. LBD is carefully crafted to promote deep and lasting learning, but we have learned that careful crafting is not enough for success in putting a collaborative inquiry approach into practice. Also essential are fostering a collaborative classroom culture in which students want to be engaged in deep learning and where the teacher sees herself as both a learner and a facilitator of learning, trusts that with her help the students can learn, and enthusiastically assumes the roles she needs to take on.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1204_2,,,,,,,,

Conceptual and Epistemic Aspects of Students' Scientific Explanations,Sandoval,2003,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article explores how students' epistemological ideas about the nature of science interact with their conceptual understanding of a particular domain, as reflected in written explanations for an event of natural selection constructed by groups of high school students through a technology-supported curriculum about evolution. Analyses intended to disentangle conceptual and epistemic aspects of explanation reveal that groups sought plausible causal accounts of observed data, and were sensitive to the need for causal coherence, while articulating explanations consistent with the theory of natural selection. Groups often failed to explicitly cite data to support key claims, however, both because of difficulty in interpreting data and because they did not seem to see explicit evidence as crucial to an explanation. These findings reveal that students have productive epistemic resources to bring to bear during inquiry, but highlight the need for an epistemic discourse around student-generated artifacts to deepen both the conceptual and epistemological understanding students may develop through inquiry.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1201_2,[framework] Epistemic Cognition;,,,,epistemic agency;evidence;,,,
Construction of Collective and Individual Knowledge in Argumentative Activity,Schwarz et al.,2003,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"In this article, we elaborate methodologies to study construction of knowledge in argumentative activities. For this purpose, we report on a quasi-empirical study on construction of knowledge through successive argumentative activities on a controversial issue. A group of 120 fifth grade students participated in successive argumentative activities; some activities involved individuals and some involved collectives. According to a first methodology, construction of knowledge was measured through arguments/outcomes produced. We developed tools for evaluating changes in individual and collective arguments. In the study, we showed the generally beneficial effect of argumentative activities on collective and individual arguments/outcomes. The significant discrepancies between collective and individual arguments suggested that individual students only partly internalized the collectively constructed arguments. We developed a qualitative methodology to refine this hypothesis as well as other hypotheses concerning the interpretation of the quantitative study. The integration of the quantitative and qualitative methodologies for studying argumentation helped identify several mechanisms of construction of knowledge in argumentative activities. In particular, it brought new light on the mediating role of representational tools such as Argumentative Maps or Pro-Con tables.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1202_3,[framework] Argumentation Theory;,,,,argumentation;collaboration;participation;,,,
An Experimental Study of the Effects of Representational Guidance on Collaborative Learning Processes,Suthers & Hundhausen,2003,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The importance of both social processes and of representational aids for learning is well-established, yet few experimental studies have addressed the combination of these factors. The research reported in this article evaluates the influence of tools for constructing representations of evidential models on collaborative learning processes and outcomes. Pairs of participants worked with 1 of 3 representations (Graph, Matrix, Text) while investigating complex science and public health problems. Dependent measures included (a) the content of participants' utterances and representational actions and the timing of these utterances and actions with respect to the availability of information; (b) a multiple choice test of the ability to recall the data, hypotheses, and evidential relations explored; and (c) the contents of a written essay. The results show that representational notations can have significant effects on learners' interactions, and may differ in their influence on subsequent collaborative use of the knowledge being manipulated. For example, Graph and Matrix users elaborated on previously represented information more than Text users. Representation and discussion of evidential relations was quantitatively greatest for Matrix users as predicted, yet this came at the cost of excessive consideration and revision of unimportant relations. Graph users may have been more focused in their consideration of evidence, and the work done in the Graph representation had the greatest impact on the contents of the essays. Although limited to initial use of representations in a laboratory setting, the work demonstrates that representational guidance of collaborative learning is worthy of study and suggests several lines of further investigation.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/S15327809JLS1202_2,,,,,collaboration;wonder;,,,

The Real Story Behind Story Problems: Effects of Representations on Quantitative Reasoning,Koedinger & Nathan,2004,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article explores how differences in problem representations change both the performance and underlying cognitive processes of beginning algebra students engaged in quantitative reasoning. Contrary to beliefs held by practitioners and researchers in mathematics education, students were more successful solving simple algebra story problems than solving mathematically equivalent equations. Contrary to some views of situated cognition, this result is not simply a consequence of situated world knowledge facilitating problem-solving performance, but rather a consequence of student difficulties with comprehending the formal symbolic representation of quantitative relations. We draw on analyses of students' strategies and errors as the basis for a cognitive process explanation of when, why, and how differences in problem representation affect problem solving. We conclude that differences in external representations can affect performance and learning when one representation is easier to comprehend than another or when one representation elicits more reliable and meaningful solution strategies than another.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1207/s15327809jls1302_1,,,,,problem solving;wonder;,,,

I synthesize research to date to articulate three patterns of distributed scaffolding and the pedagogical considerations that they target. I introduce synergy as a pattern that has not received much attention in the past. Synergy refers to the characteristic that different components of distributed scaffolding, such as software supports and teacher coaching, address the same learning need and interact with each other to produce a robust form of support. I illustrate this pattern through classroom examples and discuss the scaffolding functions that it can fulfill.

The reflection necessary for such seeing is motivated by activities and contexts that emphasize affective and social aspects. Natural language, as a representation already familiar to children, is key in these activities, both as a means of mathematical expression and as a link between situations and various abstract representations. These tools support: children’s ""ownership"" of a mathematical problem and its expression; remote sharing of problems and data; software interpretation of children’s own word problems; play with dynamically linked representations with attention to children’s prior connections; and systematic problem variation based on empirically determined level of difficulty.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1207/s15327809jls1302_3,,,,,problem solving;transfer;wonder;,,,

Shifting Engagements in Figured Worlds: Middle School Mathematics Students' Participation in an Architectural Design Project,Jurow,2005,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Project-based curricula have the potential to engage students' interests. But how do students become interested in the goals of a project? This article documents how a group of 8th-grade students participated in an architectural design project called the Antarctica Project. The project is based on the imaginary premise that students need to design a research station in Antarctica. This premise is meant to provide a meaningful context for learning mathematics. Using ethnography and discourse analysis, the article investigates students' engagement with the imaginary premise and curricular tasks during the 7-week project. A case study consisting of scenes from main phases of the project shows how the students took on concerns and responsibilities associated with the figured world proposed by the Antarctica Project and how this shaped their approaches to mathematical tasks (Holland, Lachicotte, Skinner, & Cain, 1998). Participating in the figured world of Antarctica and evaluating situations within this world was important for how students used mathematics meaningfully to solve problems. Curricular tasks and classroom activities that facilitated students in assuming and shifting between roles relevant to multiple figured worlds (i.e., of the classroom, Antarctica, and mathematics) helped them engage in the diverse intentions of curricular activities.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls1401_3,,,,,,,,

A Collective Case Study of the Use of ICT in Economics Courses: A Sociocultural Approach,Lim & Barnes,2005,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Based on a collective case study of the use of an economics Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) tutorial-based package, WinEcon, in 3 British schools, this article examines the activity structures that exist in ICT-mediated lessons situated within their broader sociocultural contexts. Activity theory and its highly developed ideas of the sociocultural conceptions of human nature and cognition are adopted to frame the study. By drawing together Gifford's (1997) mediated learning model and Cole's (1995) culture as garden metaphor, the former captures the activities mediated by students, teachers, ICT, and non-ICT tools in the course, and these are situated in the latter's broader sociocultural settings of the school, education system, and society at large. Although the article provides an account of the use of WinEcon in economics courses, its emphases are on the issues and problems of ICT integration: course objectives, teaching and learning tools, participants, sociocultural constraints, activities, and design of the learning environment. Consistent with other studies of ICT integration, there are 2 interrelated points for consideration regarding the use of ICT in enculturating students to think ""in an economics way"": (a) pivotal role of the teacher in the design of the learning environment and (b) object of activities, sociocultural constraints, and the enculturation process.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls1404_2,,,,,,,,
Technology-Mediation and Tutoring: How Do They Shape Progressive Inquiry Discourse?,Muukkonen et al.,2005,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"In higher education, there is a challenge to gain the full benefit of the potentials of learning technology for collaborative knowledge advancement and for scaffolding practices of academic literacy and scientific argumentation. The technology, ideally, would be used to provide support that enables students to deal with more demanding tasks than they could otherwise handle. We investigated the benefits of learning technology by examining the role of technology-mediation and tutoring in directing students' knowledge production in inquiry-based learning. A comparative analysis of inquiry discourse was conducted for 3 conditions between nonmediated and technology-mediated inquiry processes, the latter both tutored and nontutored. Qualitative content analysis was employed to examine how the scale of scaffolding related to the nature of knowledge produced. Furthermore, a descriptive analysis of the progression of discourse was conducted to examine evidence for deepening the question-explanation process, development of ideas in dialogue, and self-reflection. The scaffolding provided by the learning technology (The Future Learning Environment), together with the possibility for dialogue, appear to have supported practices of problem-setting, self-reflection, and collaborative development of ideas. Students in the 2 technology-mediated conditions were developing their ideas in dialogue, building on each other's knowledge and questions. Tutoring was found to be valuable for providing additional models and tools for advancing inquiry. Specific to the students of the nontechnology condition (who wrote learning-logs) was that they put more effort into understanding the theoretical content, evaluating and arguing it, but they did not engage in shared development of ideas. Through a combination of the practices, the authors foresee a potential, in higher education, for development of in-depth inquiry and practices of knowledge advancement including the nurturance of epistemic agency.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls1404_3,,,,,,,,

Learning to Collaborate: An Instructional Approach to Promoting Collaborative Problem Solving in Computer-Mediated Settings,Rummel & Spada,2005,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Effective collaboration in computer-mediated settings among spatially distributed people is a precondition for success in many new learning and working contexts but it is hard to achieve. We have developed two instructional approaches to improve collaboration in such settings by promoting people's capabilities to collaborate in a fruitful way and furthering their understanding of what characterizes good collaboration. The rationale is that strategies necessary for a good and effective computer-mediated collaboration may be conveyed to people by exposing them to an elaborated worked-out collaboration example (observational learning) or by giving them the opportunity to learn from scripted collaborative problem-solving. An experimental study was conducted that compared learning from observing a worked-out collaboration example with the learning effects of scripted collaborative problem-solving, the effects of unscripted collaborative problem-solving, and a control condition without a learning phase. The experimental design provided clearly separated phases for the instructional treatments (learning phase) and for applying and testing the acquired skills (application phase). Both observing a worked-out collaboration example and collaborating with a script during the learning phase showed positive effects on process and outcome of the second collaboration in the application phase.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls1402_2,,,,,,,,
Explaining Behavior Through Observational Investigation and Theory Articulation,Smith & Reiser,2005,Journal of the Learning Sciences,Conducting observational investigations of behaviors and processes is an important method for generating scientific knowledge. This article describes a methodology for assisting students in the processes of observational inquiry and theory articulation and its instantiation in a set of digital video tools. We describe a high school biology curriculum where students use these tools to investigate video clips of animal behavior and develop theories about how and why these behaviors evolved. We focus our discussion on an investigation model that scaffolds students through the processes of observing and explaining video as data and the computational and curricular supports that were designed to make these processes explicit. We conclude with a presentation of preliminary results to illustrate the types of explanations that emerged from working with the software and curriculum and a discussion of issues that emerged during the course of the research.,http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls1403_1,,,,,,,,

The Nature and Development of Teachers' Metastrategic Knowledge in the Context of Teaching Higher Order Thinking,Zohar,2006,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This study examines the development of teachers’ metastrategic knowledge (MSK), a component of metacognitive knowledge, in the context of higher order thinking. Participants were 14 junior high school and high school science teachers who attended a professional development course. Data collection was carried out by triangulation of several data sources: classroom observations, individual interviews, written assignments, and recordings of discussions that took place during the course. The Findings section provides a detailed analysis of the professional development of 2 teachers, as well as an analysis of the development of the 14 teachers as a group. The data provide evidence for the types of knowledge teachers need for applying MSK in the course of instruction, the most specific of which are MSK of thinking skills (that must be explicit) and pedagogical knowledge regarding MSK. The considerable overall development in teachers’ MSK following an in-service course consisted of at least 3 different patterns of development: (a) learning MSK regarding new thinking skills, (b) transforming initially implicit metalevel knowledge into explicit metalevel knowledge, and (c) introducing changes in the class culture to value new forms of discourse regarding thinking.

Designing Social Infrastructure: Critical Issues in Creating Learning Environments With Technology,Bielaczyc,2006,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"If design research involving technology-based tools is going to impact educational settings, the design process must be extended beyond the tool itself to encompass a broader range of factors such as the classroom social structures (e.g., beliefs about learning and knowledge, learning activities and participant structures, configurations of both physical space and cyberspace). Although prior research has underscored the importance of classroom social structures in technology integration, it has failed to specify the critical design variables that must be taken into account. Only by understanding the critical variables involved is it possible to develop a deep understanding of how and why things work. The Social Infrastructure Framework systematically frames the critical design elements in terms of 4 dimensions: (a) cultural beliefs, (b) practices, (c) socio-techno-spatial relations, and (d) interaction with the ""outside world.""

Framing Interactions to Foster Generative Learning: A Situative Explanation of Transfer in a Community of Learners Classroom,Engle,2006,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article develops a situative approach to explaining the transfer of learning, illustrating it using a challenging-to-explain case from a Fostering Communities of Learners classroom. The case involved a group of 5th graders who learned and then transferred a more sophisticated way of explaining species survival and endangerment despite participating in a unit in which many activities designed to foster transfer were short circuited. The explanation included 2 kinds of analyses: (a) how students participated in the learning of relevant content, and (b) how learning contexts were framed interactionally. The content analysis took a situative perspective on commonly investigated transfer mechanisms such as quality of initial learning, engagement with multiple examples, comparison between examples, and formation of generalizations. There was strong evidence for a few of these mechanisms and weak or inconclusive evidence for others. The context analysis explored 2 aspects of the relatively new hypothesis that transfer is more likely to occur when learning contexts are framed as part of a larger ongoing intellectual conversation in which students are actively involved. First, the analysis showed that the teacher worked to frame learning contexts as being temporally connected with other contexts in which the students could use what they were learning. Second, it showed that the teacher worked to frame the students as contributing members of a larger community of people interested in what they were learning about. These and other forms of framing may have encouraged the students to expect that they would be generatively using what they were learning, thus leading them to make better use of the content-based supports for transfer that were available. Thus, this study suggests that coordinating analyses of content with the framing of contexts may be a particularly fruitful approach for developing more comprehensive explanations of how and why the transfer of learning occurs.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls1504_2,,,,,,,,

On Some Necessary Conditions of Learning,Marton & Pang,2006,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The purpose of this article is to identify some necessary conditions of learning. To learn something, the learner must discern what is to be learned (the object of learning). Discerning the object of learning amounts to discerning its critical aspects. To discern an aspect, the learner must experience potential alternatives, that is, variation in a dimension corresponding to that aspect, against the background of invariance in other aspects of the same object of learning. (One could not discern the color of things, for instance, if there was only one color.) The study results illustrate that what students learn in a sequence of lessons is indeed a function of the pattern of variation and invariance constituted in that sequence. All teachers make use of variation and invariance in their teaching, but this study shows that teachers informed by a systematic framework do it more systematically, with striking effects on their students' learning.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls1502_2,,,,,,,,
Sameness and Difference in Transfer,Marton,2006,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Discussions about transfer have mainly dealt with how people manage to do something in a situation thanks to having done something similar in a previous situation. From an educational point of view, however, it appears more fruitful to consider the case when the learner, having learned to do something in 1 situation, might be able to do something different in other situations, thanks to perceived differences (and similarities) between situations. The case is made for widening the focus of attention to how situations are related through differences (and similarities).",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls1504_3,,,,,,,,
Supporting Students' Construction of Scientific Explanations by Fading Scaffolds in Instructional Materials,McNeill et al.,2006,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether providing students with continuous written instructional support or fading written instructional support (scaffolds) better prepares students to construct scientific explanations when they are no longer provided with support. This article investigated the influence of scaffolding on 331 seventh-grade students' writing of scientific explanations during an 8-week, project-based chemistry unit in which the construction of scientific explanations is a key learning goal. The unit makes an instructional model for explanation explicit to students through a focal lesson and reinforces that model through subsequent written support for each investigation. Students received 1 of 2 treatments in terms of the type of written support: continuous, involving detailed support for every investigation, or faded, involving less support over time. The analyses showed significant learning gains for students for all components of scientific explanation (i.e., claim, evidence, and reasoning). However, on posttest items lacking scaffolds, the faded group gave stronger explanations in terms of their reasoning compared to the continuous group. Fading written scaffolds better equipped students to write explanations when they were not provided with support.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls1502_1,,,,,,,,
Mastery and Appropriation as Means to Understand the Interplay of History Learning and Identity Trajectories,Polman,2006,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article uses a sociocultural approach to analyze how trajectories of identity development and learning intersect in actions carried out in a community of learners. The approach utilizes a framework for analysis with 5 aspects: the action, the agents, the goals, the cultural tools, and the scene. The study posits a distinction between mastery of the cultural tools of a discipline—in this case history—and the appropriation of those tools to relate to learners' identities and the likelihood for learners to use tools outside the context in which they are learned. The study uses the framework to analyze 2 particular moments of action within a set of project-based, after school clubs inquiring into the history of resistance to slavery. One action, which advanced a youth's identity as a history learner and participation in practices of historical inquiry, was enabled by successfully building on his identity and expertise as a computer ""gamer."" Another youth's school identity and the norms of his school constrained his action during the after school club in important ways, limiting his opportunities for learning and identity development. Implications of these findings for educators wishing to design ""hybrid"" learning environments incorporating disciplinary thinking and learner interests are discussed.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls1502_3,,,,,,,,
Multiple Epistemological Coherences in an Eighth-Grade Discussion of the Rock Cycle,Rosenberg et al.,2006,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Research on personal epistemologies (Hofer & Pintrich, 2002) has mostly conceptualized them as stable beliefs or stages of development. On these views, researchers characterize individual students' epistemologies with single, coherent descriptions. Evidence of variability in student epistemologies, however, suggests the need for more complex models. Hammer and Elby (2002) proposed modeling personal epistemologies as comprised of manifold epistemological resources. This difference in ontology—the form research attributes to cognitive structure—accounts for variability: The activation of these epistemological resources depends on context. Our purpose in this article is to argue that it also accounts for coherences in student epistemologies, in particular for multiple local coherences. We advance this argument using a case study of a 15-min discussion by a group of eighth graders about the ""rock cycle"" (the cyclic transformations of rock among different forms). We begin with evidence of the students' working from a stable, coherent epistemological stance. Then, after a brief, purely epistemological intervention by the teacher, the evidence indicates they are working from a different but also coherent and stable epistemological stance.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls1502_4,,,,,,,,

Tracing the Evolution of Pedagogical Content Knowledge as the Development of Interanimated Discourses,Seymour & Lehrer,2006,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"For this article, the development of 1 teacher's pedagogical content knowledge (Shulman, 1986) was tracked longitudinally across 2 years as she taught a new instructional unit in middle school mathematics. Growth in pedagogical content knowledge is characterized as the interanimation of 2 Discourses (Gee, 1999). One Discourse refers to characteristic ways that students talk and act about the mathematics of the unit; and the other Discourse, to characteristic ways that the teacher talks and acts as she guides the development of students' mathematical thinking. At the inception of the unit, the variety of small d discourses students and teacher generated were only loosely coupled. Initially, the teacher responded to variations in student talk and activity by employing general revoicing heuristics, such as repeating what a student had said so that others could hear or by asking a question to elicit further elaboration of a particular student's pattern of thought. As the teacher attempted to orchestrate classroom conversations oriented toward developing mathematical understanding, these general heuristics often failed to transform student thinking in ways that she considered mathematically productive. As a consequence, she generated new conversational gambits that were more often tuned to particular elements of students' mathematical talk and activity. Some of these forms of talk created more fruitful classroom discourse about mathematics, which the teacher increasingly recognized as signals of particular ways of thinking about the mathematics (of slope). The teacher was not content with mere recognition. She elaborated and continued to innovate. Conjectures about the growth of pedagogical content knowledge were tested in video-stimulated structured interviews with the teacher and by modeling the syntax of teacher support of student thinking—predicting specific patterns of couplings between student and teacher Discourses. This article concludes with a discussion of the implications of this view for the ontogenesis of adaptive expertise.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls1504_5,,,,,,,,
Small-Group Reflections: Parallels Between Teacher Discourse and Student Behavior in Peer-Directed Groups,Webb et al.,2006,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Prior research on small-group collaboration identifies several behaviors that significantly predict student learning, such as exchanging explanations and applying help received. Previous reports focus on student behavior to understand why many students do not engage in behaviors predictive of learning, leaving unexplored how teachers may influence small-group interaction. Consequently, this article describes established teacher practices and examines whether and how students reproduce teacher discourse in the context of a semester-long program of cooperative learning in four middle school mathematics classrooms. This article illustrates changes that emerged and factors that made change difficult. The research concludes that student behavior largely mirrored the discourse modeled by and the expectations communicated by teachers. Teachers tended to give unlabeled calculations, procedures, or answers instead of labeled explanations. Teachers often instructed using a recitation approach in which they assumed primary responsibility for solving the problem, having students only provide answers to discrete steps. Finally, teachers rarely encouraged students to verbalize their thinking or to ask questions. Students adopting the role of help-giver showed behavior very similar to that of the teacher: doing most of the work, providing mostly low-level help, and infrequently monitoring other students’ level of understanding. The relatively passive behavior of students needing help corresponded to expectations communicated by the teacher about the learner as a fairly passive recipient of the teacher’s transmitted knowledge.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls1501_8,,,,,,,,
Dialogue in the Classroom,Wells & Arauz,2006,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"There is increasing agreement among those who study classrooms that learning is likely to be most effective when students are actively involved in the dialogic coconstruction of meaning about topics that are of significance to them. This article reports the results of an extended collaborative action research project in which teachers attempted to create the conditions for such dialogue by adopting an inquiry approach to the curriculum. A quantitative comparison between observations made early and late in the teachers’ involvement in the project showed a number of significant changes in the characteristics of teacher–whole-class discourse, with a shift toward a more dialogic mode of interaction. Nevertheless, the initiation-response-follow-up (IRF) genre continued to be pervasive. Despite this, when the same observations were examined qualitatively, there was clear evidence of an increase over time in the teachers’ adoption of a “dialogic stance.” The article concludes with a consideration of the relationship between the choice of discourse formats and the enactment of a dialogic stance.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327809jls1503_3,,,,,,,,

Discourse Patterns During Children's Collaborative Online Discussions,Kim et al.,2007,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article examines the discourse of 10 groups of children during text-based online discussions. Analysis of the discourse in the discussions showed that 8 different rhetorical moves, or argument stratagems, were used by most groups of children, whereas 3 other stratagems were used by 1 group. The use of argument stratagems snowballed; that is, once an argument stratagem emerged in a discussion, it tended to spread to other children in the Web group, and the likelihood that it would occur again remained high over the course of the discussion. Most stratagems began to spread when initiated by other children but not when introduced by the adult moderator. Children were eager to participate and displayed a high rate of participation in discussions with Webmates from distant classrooms. These findings suggest that collaborative online discussions may provide an effective instructional medium for promoting children's learning of reasoning strategies and thinking skills.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400701413419,,,,,,,,
"To Disagree, We Must Also Agree: How Intersubjectivity Structures and Perpetuates Discourse in a Mathematics Classroom",Nathan et al.,2007,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Learning in a socially mediated context like a classroom places emphasis on the ability of learners to communicate their ideas to others, and for members of a class to achieve shared meaning or intersubjectivity (IS). We take a participatory view of IS, where both consensual agreement and disagreement are regarded as aspects of a common set of processes that mediate collective activity. Interlocutors need not demonstrate convergence toward a common idea or solution to exhibit IS and, indeed, they appear to need a shared understanding to express substantive disagreement through divergent views. Multilevel, multimodal analyses of videotape of a middle school mathematics classroom, including speech, gestures, drawing, and object use, reveal a discourse that is organized into recurrent sequences of event triads. The dynamics toward and away from convergent ideas appears to be instrumental in fostering sustained and engaging discourse and influencing the representations that students propose during problem solving. Participants frequently exhibited IS, but, as allowed for in the participatory view, the interactions did not seem to convert many students from their initial interpretations. Instead, disagreements and a desire to establish common understanding appeared to lead participants to express their divergent views in more refined and accessible ways. Advancement of our understanding of the role that IS serves in socially mediated learning has the potential to inform both educational theory and emerging areas in embodied cognition and cognitive neuroscience that addresses imitation and empathy, and thus help to bridge research between brain function and social cognition.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400701525238,,,,,,,,
What Does “Fast” Mean? Understanding the Physical World Through Computational Representations,Parnafes,2007,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article concerns the development of conceptual understanding of a physical phenomenon through the use of computational representations. It examines how students make sense of and interpret computational representations, and how their understanding of the represented physical phenomenon develops in this process. Eight studies were conducted, in which pairs of students were engaged in an exploratory activity of natural harmonic oscillation. They first explored physical oscillators (e.g., springs, pendulums) and then interacted with dynamic and interactive computational representations that represent aspects of natural harmonic oscillation. The analysis focuses on selected episodes demonstrating critical steps in the development of the students' understanding. It offers a detailed description of these steps and closely examines students' interaction with various features of the representations in order to identify the relations between use of representations and students' developing understanding. A theory of conceptual change, coordination class theory (diCitationSessa & Sherin, 1998), is used to track the development process of students' understanding with representations. The detailed analysis aims to construct a model describing mechanisms of developing understanding through the mediation of computational representations. The significance of this study is in its close look at the detailed process of learning and conceptual change in computational environments.First and foremost, I amindebted to my advisor, Andrea diSessa, for his extensive support and guidance in framing and developing this research.

Comparing Classroom Enactments of an Inquiry Curriculum: Lessons Learned From Two Teachers,Puntambekar et al.,2007,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Examining how teachers structure the activities in a unit and how they facilitate classroom discussion is important to understand how innovative technology-rich curricula work in the context of classroom instruction. This study compared 2 enactments of an inquiry curriculum, then examined students' learning outcomes in classes taught by 2 teachers. The quantitative data show that there were significant differences in the learning outcomes of students in classes of the 2 teachers. This study then examined classroom enactments by the 2 teachers to understand the differences in the learning outcomes. This research specifically focused on how teacher-led discussions (a) helped connect the activities within a curriculum unit and (b) enabled deeper conceptual understanding by helping students make connections between science concepts and principles. This study examined the role that teacher facilitation played in helping students focus on the relations between the various activities in the unit and the concepts that they were learning. The results point to important differences in the 2 enactments, helping to understand better what strategies might enable a deeper conceptual understanding of the science content.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508400709336943,,,,,,,,
"When the Rules of Discourse Change, but Nobody Tells You: Making Sense of Mathematics Learning From a Commognitive Standpoint",Sfard,2007,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The interpretive framework for the study of learning introduced in this article and called commognitive is grounded in the assumption that thinking is a form of communication and that learning mathematics is tantamount to modifying and extending one's discourse. These basic tenets lead to the conclusion that substantial discursive change, rather than being necessitated by an extradiscursive reality, is spurred by commognitive conflict, that is, by the situation that arises whenever different interlocutors are acting according to differing discursive rules. The framework is applied in 2 studies, one of them featuring a class learning about negative numbers and the other focusing on 2 first graders learning about triangles and quadrilaterals. In both cases, the analysis of data is guided by questions about (a) features of the new mathematical discourse that set it apart from the mathematical discourse in which the students were conversant when the learning began; (b) students' and teachers' efforts toward the necessary discursive transformation; and (c) effects of the learning–teaching process, that is, the extent of discursive change actually resulting from these efforts. One of the claims corroborated by the findings is that school learning requires an active lead of an experienced interlocutor and needs to be fueled by a learning-teaching agreement between the interlocutor and the learners.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400701525253,,,,,,,,
Augmented Reality Simulations on Handheld Computers,Squire & Klopfer,2007,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Advancements in handheld computing, particularly its portability, social interactivity, context sensitivity, connectivity, and individuality, open new opportunities for immersive learning environments. This article articulates the pedagogical potential of augmented reality simulations in environmental engineering education by immersing students in the roles of scientists conducting investigations. This design experiment examined if augmented reality simulation games can be used to help students understand science as a social practice, whereby inquiry is a process of balancing and managing resources, combining multiple data sources, and forming and revising hypotheses in situ. We provide 4 case studies of secondary environmental science students participating in the program. Positioning students in virtual investigations made apparent their beliefs about science and confronted simplistic beliefs about the nature of science. Playing the game in “real” space also triggered students' preexisting knowledge, suggesting that a powerful potential of augmented reality simulation games can be in their ability to connect academic content and practices with students' physical, lived worlds. The game structure provided students a narrative to think with, although students differed in their ability to create a coherent narrative of events. We argue that Environmental Detectives is 1 model for helping students understand the socially situated nature of scientific practice.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400701413435,,,,,,,,

Expanding the Disciplinary Expertise of a Middle School Mathematics Classroom: Re-Contextualizing Student Models in Conversations With Visiting Specialists,Jurow et al.,2008,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article examines how conversations during design reviews in which 8th-grade mathematics students shared population models with visiting specialists expanded the disciplinary expertise of the classroom. Re-contextualizing is a conversational exchange that visiting specialists initiated to invite groups to consider their models in novel contexts. Analysis of 14 design reviews in 2 classrooms showed that re-contextualizing resulted in both the elaboration of ideas students already understood and new contributions to students' understandings of mathematical aspects of population modeling. This article presents case studies of 2 groups that differed in terms of their interest in the curricular task and the level of conceptual integrity of their population models. Despite these differences, the re-contextualizing exchanges that emerged in their design reviews led to new insights for both groups and provided them with opportunities to try on ways of thinking and acting like population biologists.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400802192714,,,,,,,,
"Guided Participation in Three Youth Activism Organizations: Facilitation, Apprenticeship, and Joint Work",Kirshner,2008,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Multiracial youth activism groups, based in working class and poor neighborhoods, seek to improve social conditions by organizing grassroots campaigns. Campaigns such as these, which require sophisticated planning, organizing, and advocacy skills, are noteworthy not just for their political impact, but also because of the insights they provide about learning environments outside of school. In this study I adopted CitationRogoff's (2003) theory of guided participation as a lens through which to analyze adult approaches to working with youth and how these approaches relate to opportunities for youth to participate in social action. Drawing on 2 years of ethnographic fieldwork in 3 multiracial activism groups, I found that adults managed tensions between youth empowerment principles and the task demands of campaigns in 3 distinct ways: facilitation, apprenticeship, and joint work. This analysis is relevant to educators who wish to support youth participation in mature social practices and researchers interested in elective learning environments.Previous articleView issue table of contents",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400701793190,,,,,,,,
Fertile Zones of Cultural Encounter in Computer Science Education,Kolikant & Ben-Ari,2008,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"We explain certain learning difficulties in computer science education as resulting from a clash between the students' culture as computer users and the professional computing culture. We propose the concept of fertile zones of cultural encounter as a way of overcoming these learning difficulties. This pedagogical approach aims to bridge the gap between cultures by designing interventions that are appreciated by members of both cultures, yet also guide the student to engage in the practices of the professional culture. The learning difficulties are demonstrated by a detailed analysis of episodes taken from an advanced high school computer science course in concurrency.

The Dark Matter of Lab Work: Illuminating the Negotiation of Disciplined Perception in Mechanics,Lindwall & Lymer,2008,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This study examines the practical work of a pair of students and an instructor using probeware in a mechanics lab. The aim of the study is to describe and discuss a type of interactional sequence that we refer to as dark matter, the ordinary backdrop to the extraordinary sequences that are easily recognizable as clear-cut instances of learning. Although this work is downplayed in the research literature, describing it is critical to properly understanding lab work as an educational practice. With a focus on the negotiation of disciplined perception, we analyze a number of episodes wherein a pair of students and an instructor struggle with the construction and interpretation of a graph depicting a linear relationship between force and acceleration. We demonstrate an intimate interplay between how the students display their problems and understandings and how the instructor tries to make the subject matter content visible and thus learnable. The analyzed episodes are illuminating with regard to the analytical notion of disciplined perception as applied to graph interpretation; the cognitive and practical competencies involved in producing, recognizing, and understanding graphs in mechanics; and the interactive work by which these competencies are made into objects of learning and instruction.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400801986082,,,,,,,,
Using Blogging in Support of Teacher Professional Identity Development: A Case Study,Luehmann,2008,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This case study explores the affordances a weblog (blog) offered to “Ms. Frizzle,” an urban middle school science teacher and exceptional blogger, to support her professional identity development. The 316 posts she wrote over 1 school year were systematically analyzed and triangulated with data from e-mail exchanges and interviews with Ms. Frizzle and her colleagues. Ms. Frizzle used her blog to tell stories of herself and her classroom, reflect on her practice, work through dilemmas, solicit feedback, and display competence, among other things. By doing so, she was able to wrestle with many issues that are central to the practice of urban science teaching and be recognized by herself and others as a “reform-minded” teacher committed to excellence and equity in education. To realize these benefits, however, Ms. Frizzle invested significant time and energy into her blogging and made certain uses of blogging features. Thus, although this study empirically supports the potential of blogging for teachers' professional identity development, it also indicates that the way in which teachers use blogging will determine the extent of the benefits they can derive from this practice.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400802192706,,,,,,,,
The Seeds of Time: Why Classroom Dialogue Needs a Temporal Analysis,Mercer,2008,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The process of teaching and learning in school has a natural long-term trajectory and cannot be understood only as a series of discrete educational events. Classroom talk plays an important role in mediating this long-term process, and in this article I argue that more attention should be given to the temporal dimension of classroom dialogue, both empirically and theoretically, if we are to appreciate how children gain an education from their classroom experience. I explore this topic using data from recent applied, interventional research in United Kingdom primary schools and examine how classroom talk is used to represent past shared experience, carry ideas forward from one occasion to another, approach future activities, and achieve learning outcomes. The article ends with a discussion of the theoretical, methodological, and educational implications of making this kind of temporal analysis.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400701793182,,,,,,,,
"“I Went by Twos, He Went by One”: Multiple Interpretations of Inscriptions as Resources for Mathematical Discussions",Moschkovich,2008,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article examines a classroom discussion of multiple interpretations of the scales on two distance versus time graphs. The analysis describes how two students and a teacher used multiple meanings for phrases of the form “I went by” and coordinated these meanings with different views of the scales. Students' ambiguous and shifting meanings did not prove to be obstacles to this discussion. Instead, this teacher used student interpretations as resources, built on them, and connected them to canonical mathematical concepts—in particular by highlighting (CitationGoodwin, 1994) a “unitized” (CitationLamon, 1994, Citation1996, Citation2007) view of the scales. Research in mathematics education describes teaching that promotes conceptual development as having two central features: One is that teachers and students attend explicitly to concepts, and the other is that students wrestle with important mathematics (CitationHiebert & Grouws, 2007). Not only does this classroom discussion provide an example that it is possible to balance these two features, but the analysis provides the details of how instruction can simultaneously provide explicit attention to concepts while allowing students to wrestle with these concepts.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400802395077,,,,,,,,
"From the Court to the Classroom: Opportunities for Engagement, Learning, and Identity in Basketball and Classroom Mathematics",Nasir & Hand,2008,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This study explored support for engagement in 2 settings: a high school basketball team and high school mathematics classrooms. Specifically, the study examined 3 aspects of these practices: (a) access to the domain, (b) opportunities to take on integral roles, and (c) opportunities for self-expression in the practice. Drawing on videotape and interview data from 2 African American high school students' participation in basketball and mathematics class, as well as interviews with players' teachers and coaches, this article analyzes how these 3 aspects of practices afforded differential engagement across settings. Findings: indicated that the practice of basketball supported deep engagement as players had greater access to an understanding of the domain, were assigned and took up a unique role that was integral to the practice, and had opportunities to express themselves and feel competent. The high school mathematics classroom differentially afforded these opportunities, with 1 student taking them up and the other being unable to, and thus being less engaged.

Scaling Up Innovative Technology-Based Mathematics,Tatar et al.,2008,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"We report on the initial attempts at evaluating at scale a particular technological/curricular innovation that enables more students to develop deeper knowledge. The methods, issues, and findings of the current pilot experiment speak not only to the success of SimCalc MathWorlds, the focus of our research program, but also to the evaluation at scale of a broad class of representationally innovative technologies and to the merit of long-term investment in design-based research. In particular, we present conditions and findings from a completed pilot experiment involving 21 seventh-grade mathematics teachers from Texas. Pilot outcomes suggest that (a) innovative representational technologies can have an important impact on student learning, (b) considerable impact can be found across a wide range of teachers and conditions, and (c) these gains can be detected even in the absence of other desirable conditions. In particular, detection of student gains does not, in our case, depend on having a long-term context of learning, long-term teacher professional development, or a shift to learner-centered constructivist pedagogy. The full experiment will replicate and extend our experimental design with a wider range of teachers and schools, model the factors that contribute to classroom success with such technology, and explore what happens as research support fades away.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400801986090,,,,,,,,
Designs for Collective Cognitive Responsibility in Knowledge-Building Communities,Zhang et al.,2009,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article reports a design experiment conducted over three successive school years, with the teacher’s goal of having his Grade 4 students assume increasing levels of collective responsibility for advancing their knowledge of optics. Classroom practices conducive to sustained knowledge building were co-constructed by the teacher and students, with Knowledge Forum software supporting the production and refinement of the community’s knowledge. Social network analysis and qualitative analyses were used to assess online participatory patterns and knowledge advances, focusing on indicators of collective cognitive responsibility. Data indicate increasingly effective procedures, mirrored in students’ knowledge advances, corresponding to the following organizations: (a) Year 1—fixed small-groups; (b) Year 2—interacting small-groups with substantial cross-group knowledge sharing; and (c) Year 3—opportunistic collaboration, with small teams forming and disbanding under the volition of community members, based on emergent goals. The third-year model maps most directly onto organic and distributed social structures in real-world knowledge-creating organizations and resulted in the highest level of collective cognitive responsibility, knowledge advancement, and dynamic diffusion of information.

Optical Pulsars and Black Arrows: Discoveries as Occasioned Productions,Koschmann & Zemel,2009,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The current article represents a methodological proposal. It seeks to address the question of how one might recognize a discovery as a discovery without knowing in advance what is available to be discovered. We propose a solution and demonstrate it using data from a study previously reported by J. CitationRoschelle (1992). Roschelle investigated 2 students' developing understandings of certain abstract features of Newtonian mechanics while working within a computer-based microworld, the Envisioning Machine. We employ an approach we term discovery as occasioned production to reexamine his data. Such an approach proceeds stepwise from the identification of some matter discovered, working backward to see just where that matter entered the conversation and then, finally, tracing from that point forward to illuminate how the proposal for a possible discovery was ultimately transformed into a discovery achieved. The notion of “evident vagueness,” borrowed from H. Garfinkel, M. Lynch, and D. CitationLivingston's (1981) account of the discovery of an optical pulsar, emerges as an important feature of our analysis. Following H. CitationGarfinkel (2002), we present our findings as a “tutorial problem” and offer a suggestion for how a program of practice studies in the learning sciences might be pursued.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400902797966,,,,,,,,
Synergy Between Teacher Practices and Curricular Scaffolds to Support Students in Using Domain-Specific and Domain-General Knowledge in Writing Arguments to Explain Phenomena,McNeill & Krajcik,2009,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"We investigated how 2 different curricular scaffolds (context-specific vs. generic), teacher instructional practices, and the interaction between these 2 types of support influenced students' learning of science content and their ability to write scientific arguments to explain phenomena. The context-specific scaffolds provided students with hints about the task and what content knowledge to use in or incorporate into their writing. The generic scaffolds supported students in understanding a general framework (i.e., claim, evidence, and reasoning) regardless of the content area or task. This study focused on an 8-week middle school chemistry curriculum that was enacted by 6 teachers with 578 students during the 2004–2005 school year. Analyses of identical pre- and posttests as well as videotapes of teacher enactments revealed that the curricular scaffolds and teacher instructional practices were synergistic in that the effect of the written curricular scaffolds depended on the teacher's enactment of the curriculum. The context-specific curricular scaffolds were more successful in supporting students in writing scientific arguments to explain phenomena, but only when teachers' enactments provided explicit domain-general support for the claim, evidence, and reasoning framework, suggesting the importance of both types of support in successful learning environments.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400903013488,,,,,,,,
Preparing Teachers to Design Instruction for Deep Understanding in Middle School Earth Science,Penuel & Gallagher,2009,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This study compared the efficacy of 3 approaches to professional development in middle school Earth science organized around the principles of Understanding by Design (CitationWiggins & McTighe, 1998) in a sample of 53 teachers from a large urban district. Teachers were randomly assigned to a control group or to 1 of 3 conditions that varied with respect to the conceptions of ideal curriculum use embedded within. Teachers either designed units of instruction, adopted units developed by expert Earth scientists and Earth science educators, or learned principled ways to adapt expert-designed curricula. Relying on data from surveys and independent ratings of naturally occurring teacher assignments, we used hierarchical linear modeling techniques to analyze the impacts of the professional development on how teachers planned and coordinated instruction. Our results suggest that to realize positive effects on both their planning and coordination of instruction, teachers need access to high-quality curriculum materials and professional development that helps them plan for principled adaptation of those materials.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400903191904,,,,,,,,

Formal principles are presented with several examples from different topics, and students choose the one that interests them most. Example choice might be related to prior knowledge, interest, or perceived control. In an experimental study, we examined the effects of degree of example choice and degree of prior knowledge on interest, perceived control, and learning outcomes in a presentation on confirmation bias. The main finding was that participants who could choose an example showed more interest in the presentation of the formal principle than participants who either were given an example by the experimenter or only saw the presentation. Control was lowest for the group without example choice and without prior knowledge. Finally, prior knowledge, but not example choice, increased performance on a transfer of knowledge task. Example choice thus offers a new approach for closing the gap between formal principles as presented at school and a student's interests.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400903191896,,,,,,,,
The Emergence of 3D Geometry From Children's (Teacher-Guided) Classification Tasks,Roth & Thom,2009,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Geometry, classification, and the classification of geometrical objects are integral aspects of recent curriculum documents in mathematics education. Such curriculum documents, however, leave open how the work of classifying objects according to geometrical properties can be accomplished given that the knowledge of these properties is the planned outcome of the curriculum or lesson. The fundamental question of the present study therefore is this: How can a lesson in which children are asked to participate in a task of classifying regular 3-dimensional objects be a geometry lesson, given that the participating 2nd-grade children do not yet classify according to geometrical properties (predicates)? In our analyses, which are inspired by ethnomethodological studies of work, we focus on the embodied and collective work that leads to the emergence of the geometrical nature of this lesson. Thus, we report both the collective and the individual work by means of which the lesson outcomes—the complete classification of a set of “mystery” objects according to geometrical (shape) rather than other (color, size, “pointy-ness”) properties—are achieved. In the process, our study shows how geometrical work is reproduced by 2nd-grade children who, in a division of labor with their teachers, produce a particular set of geometrical practices (sorting three-dimensional objects according to their geometrical properties) for the 1st time.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400802581692,,,,,,,,
In Defense of Clarity in the Study of Personal Epistemology,Sandoval,2009,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Andrew Elby (this issue) argues that researchers in the field of personal epistemology should beware insistence on a narrow definition of epistemology to guide this work. His argument is a response to suggestions (CitationHofer & Pintrich, 1997; CitationSandoval, 2005) that the study of personal epistemology should focus on people's views about knowledge and knowing and not conflate those with views about learning. His main concern is that learners' views about knowledge and their views about learning may, in fact, be conflated and that an insistence on definitional clarity could lead to a mischaracterization of cognitive structures. In this response I argue that clarity in the definition of theoretical constructs does not imply exclusion of views about learning from the study of personal epistemology. Furthermore, given the history of this area of research, failing to more clearly define our constructs makes real theoretical progress difficult.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400802581700,,,,,,,,
The Purchasing Practice of Low-Income Students: The Relationship to Mathematical Development,Taylor,2009,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The purpose of this 2-part study was to explore the mathematical and purchasing competencies present in students' engagement in shopping practices in a low-income African American neighborhood. Study 1 consisted of in situ analyses of children's shopping activities at a local store, revealing the variety of arithmetic tasks that emerged in relation to varied artifacts, shopping routines, social norms, and clerk support. In an effort to reveal competencies that could not be measured through observation alone, Study 2 consisted of individual interviews of 30 first and second graders about tasks that required them to purchase items at a mock store. Analyses revealed both strategies that were frequently and infrequently associated with successful purchasing and the relationship between children's strategy choices and the demands of particular purchases. This research documents the many mathematical competencies children present that may not be captured in traditional school assessments and considers how this prior knowledge might be used to inform instruction and treatments of sociocultural frameworks.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400903013462,,,,,,,,
Measuring Complex Features of Science Instruction: Developing Tools to Investigate the Link Between Teaching and Learning,Thadani et al.,2009,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"There is a growing national recognition that teachers and teaching are at the heart of successful educational reform. However, few tools exist for measuring classroom instruction. The primary purpose of this article is to describe methods we developed to measure and study teaching, specifically while teachers were using a multimedia intervention for promoting scientific problem solving. Lessons were videotaped, and coding schemes were developed to measure 2 aspects of teaching: (a) the lesson's organization, particularly whole-class instruction used to introduce problems and share students' work; and (b) the nature of tasks and questions given to students. Results showed that the coding schemes were reliable and that they detected differences in instruction across teachers. Qualitative analyses were consistent with the quantitative findings. The codes also captured features of teaching that would have been difficult to detect or verify with qualitative observations alone. Finally, we explored how these measures could be used with student outcome data to examine the relationship between teaching and learning in future studies. We argue that quantitative measures of instruction serve many purposes, not the least of which is allowing researchers to explore the relationship between teaching and student learning at a high degree of granularity.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400902797941,,,,,,,,

Comparing Simple and Advanced Video Tools as Supports for Complex Collaborative Design Processes,Zahn et al.,2010,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Digital video technologies, particularly advanced video tools with editing capabilities, offer new prospects for meaningful learning through design. However, it is also possible that the additional complexity of such tools does not advance learning. In an experiment, we compared the design processes and learning outcomes of 24 collaborating participant pairs (dyads), using two contrasting types of video tools for history learning. The advanced video tool, WebDiver, supported segmenting, editing and annotating capabilities. In the contrasting condition, students used a simple video playback tool with a word processor to perform the design task. Results indicate that the advanced video editing tool was more effective in relation to (1) the students’ understanding of the topic and cognitive skills acquisition (2) the quality of the student’s design products (3) the efficiency of dyad interactions. The implications of our experimental findings for constructivist and design-based learning are that mediating functions of video tools may be used as supports, for example, when students learn by solving design tasks in school.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508401003708399,[framework] Cognitive Apprenticeship;,,[method] Collaborative Design Research;[method] Experimental Design;[method] Video Analysis;,[setting] higher education;[technology] intelligent tutoring systems;[technology] mixed reality;,,,,

Disciplinary Literacy in History: An Exploration of the Historical Nature of Adolescents' Writing,Monte-Sano,2010,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"As the call for adolescent literacy grows louder, attention must be paid to the particular demands of each discipline if educators are to help students develop advanced literacy skills. The hallmarks of advanced literacy are specific to different fields of study. This article proposes a descriptive framework for adolescents' historical writing. Qualitative analyses of 56 written responses to a document-based essay question by high school juniors are used to identify and illustrate trends in adolescents' use of evidence in their historical writing. These trends—referred to as characteristics of students' historical writing—include factual and interpretive accuracy, persuasiveness of evidence, sources of evidence, corroboration of evidence, and contextualization of evidence. This article identifies benchmarks and shares a range of student work samples for each characteristic. Defining the nature of historical writing provides a framework for integrating literacy and content and for exploring and developing advanced literacy skills through the particularities of subject-specific composition.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2010.481014,,,,,,,,

Inspired by Bakhtin's notion of heteroglossia, a design team consisting of an experienced classroom teacher and 2 researchers investigated how a class of 3rd and 4th graders came to understand disciplinary points of view on heat, heat transfer, and the particulate nature of matter. Through a series of planned and unplanned encounters, official versions of the Second Law of Thermodynamics and the particulate view of matter were juxtaposed with varied domains of experience of heat transfer and phase change in water. We analyze the children's discourse to examine how they populated these phenomena with meaning and what they learned in the process.

Learning Processes in Chemistry: Drawing Upon Cognitive Resources to Learn About the Particulate Structure of Matter,Taber & García-Franco,2010,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article explores 11- to 16-year-old students' explanations for phenomena commonly studied in school chemistry from an inclusive cognitive resources or knowledge-in-pieces perspective that considers that student utterances may reflect the activation of knowledge elements at a range of levels of explicitness. We report 5 themes in student explanations that we consider to derive from implicit knowledge elements activated in cognition. Student thinking in chemistry has commonly been examined from a misconceptions or alternative conceptions/frameworks perspective, in which the focus has been on the status of learners' explicit conceptions. This approach has been valuable, but it fails to explain the origins or nature of the full range of alternative ideas reported. In physics education, the cognitive resources perspective has led to work to characterize implicit knowledge elements—described as phenomenological primitives (p-prims)—that provide learners with an intuitive sense of mechanism. School chemistry offers a complementary knowledge domain because of its focus on the nature of materials and its domination by theoretical models that explain observable phenomena in terms of emergent properties of complex ensembles of “quanticles” (molecules, ions, electrons, atoms, etc.) The themes reported in this study suggest a need to recognize primitive knowledge elements beyond those reported from physics education and suggest that some previously characterized p-prims may be better considered to derive from more broadly applicable intuitive knowledge elements.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508400903452868,,,,,,,,
A Transfer-in-Pieces Consideration of the Perception of Structure in the Transfer of Learning,Wagner,2010,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Many approaches to the transfer problem argue that transfer depends on the recognition of the same or similar abstract structure in 2 different situations. However, mainstream cognitive perspectives and contrasting Piagetian constructivist accounts differ in their conceptualizations of structure. These differences, not clearly articulated in the literature, have significant implications for accounts of transfer. Using interview data involving undergraduates learning elementary principles of probability and statistics, and Wagner’s (2006) transfer-in-pieces perspective, I extend existing constructivist accounts of transfer in at least 2 ways. First, I show how the notion of a concept projection (diSessa & Wagner, 2005; Wagner, 2006) reveals fine-grained mechanisms of transfer that demonstrate how people structure situations and that elaborate on the Piagetian processes of assimilation and accommodation. Second, I examine how what experts consider a single mathematical concept or principle may come to be recognized through a variety of assimilatory cognitive resources whose usefulness is influenced by contextual factors. That is, an individual might structure 2 contextually dissimilar situations differently while perceiving the same mathematical principle at work in both. Similarly, 2 or more individuals may agree on the relevance of a particular mathematical concept in a situation, even though each structures the situation differently.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2010.505138,,,,,,,,
Distributed by Design: On the Promises and Pitfalls of Collaborative Learning with Multiple Representations,White & Pea,2011,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article presents a designed learning environment intended to engage students in learning about the relationships among multiple representations as they work together on a shared task. Over the course of several extended problemsolving sessions, groups developed several successive alignments of participants and representations as they learned to solve increasingly difficult tasks. Our findings highlight the emergent and often unexpected meanings that learners established for representational tools as their groups reorganized into increasingly effective problem-solving ensembles. Our findings echo those of prior research regarding learners’ considerable competence and creativity in interpreting and applying distributed representational tools, as well as the careful coordination among learners involved in establishing and acting on those interpretations. Challenges in this design space include instances in our data where students capitalized on connections among representations without really trying to understand those connections, temporarily undermined the distributed character of the representations, and worked more efficiently by reducing the number of participants actively involved in breaking codes. Our findings indicate that managing these challenges requires presenting groups with regular opportunities to reconsider and reorganize their roles, and to experiment with different meanings and uses of flexible tools in the context of tasks with carefully sequenced levels of difficulty.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2010.542700,[framework] Distributed Cognition;,,[method] Video Analysis;,[population] middle school;[setting] summer school;,collaboration;disruption;agency;wonder;,,,
Strategic Facilitation of Problem-Based Discussion for Teacher Professional Development,Zhang et al.,2011,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Engaging teachers in discussing and analyzing problems of practice has great potential for teacher professional development, yet little is known about how to facilitate such discussion. This study examined the strategies that experienced facilitators used to promote productive discussion among science teachers. Participants were 6 facilitators and 35 in-service teachers who participated in a professional development program that adopted a problem-based learning approach for teacher learning. Data analysis showed that experienced facilitators used a variety of strategies in their facilitation, including questioning, revoicing, making connections, clarifying, reframing, summarizing, role playing, meta-talk, and modeling. In particular, questioning and revoicing were the most important strategies in all sessions studied, accounting for about half of the facilitators’ talk. Analysis further revealed both productive and disruptive characteristics of questioning and revoicing. In addition, analysis found that teachers were able to make progress in participating in the problem-based learning discourse in different ways.

Results were analyzed from the perspective of student, teacher, and principal engagement to identify conditions for Knowledge Building as a school-wide innovation. Analyses of student discourse showed interactive and complementary contributions to a community knowledge space, conceptual content of growing scope and depth, and collective responsibility for knowledge advancement. Analyses of teacher and principal engagement showed supportive conditions such as shared vision and trust in student competencies to the point of enabling transfer of agency for knowledge advancement to students; everdeepening understanding of Knowledge Building principles; knowledge emergent through collective responsibility; a coherent systems perspective; teacher professional Knowledge Building communities; and leadership supportive of innovation at all levels.

Using Social Network Graphs as Visualization Tools to Influence Peer Selection Decision-Making Strategies to Access Information About Complex Socioscientific Issues,Yoon,2011,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This study extends previous research that explores how visualization affordances that computational tools provide and social network analyses that account for individualand group-level dynamic processes can work in conjunction to improve learning outcomes. The study’s main hypothesis is that when social network graphs are used in instruction, students receive otherwise hidden information that influences more strategic decision making about whom to interact with in order to gain more knowledge. This in turn can influence a shift in how students interpret the nature of socioscientific issues toward a more complex understanding. Results of the intervention show that among this population of 76 Grade 7 students, rules by which students selected whom to talk to in paired discussions about a complex socioscientific issue shifted from nonreflective or socially driven mechanisms (e.g., waiting for any random person) to reflective or information-driven mechanisms (e.g., specifically choosing someone who had a lot of knowledge).

Disentangling Robust Developmental Constraints From the Instructionally Mutable: Young Children's Epistemic Reasoning About a Study of Their Own Design,Metz,2011,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This study examines first graders' epistemic reasoning, in tacit “practical epistemologies” reflected in thinking about an investigation of their own design. I analyzed children's epistemic reasoning, following a design experiment scaffolding increasing regulation of scientific inquiry in a domain they studied in depth. Participants consisted of children in two first grade classes (n = 35). The study capitalizes on the final phase of the design experiment, wherein pairs assumed substantial responsibility for design and implementation of an investigation pursuing their own question. I conducted structured interviews with each pair, eliciting their thinking about their investigation. Forty-three percent of the children attributed uncertainty to their findings. Forty-nine percent transcended phenomenon-based reasoning in thinking about how to improve their study, reasoning instead in terms of relation between variables. Forty percent posited additional potentially influential variables, reflecting a tacit understanding of the lack of any straightforward one-to-one correspondence between cause and effect. These findings suggest that epistemic reasoning is plastic, sensitive to instructional opportunities. I argue that the children's relatively deep familiarity with the domain, experience in assuming increasing responsibility for structuring scientific inquiry, and investment they had in their own investigations contributed to the surprisingly robust epistemic reasoning they revealed in this context.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2011.529325,,,,,,,,

Collectively, the experimental group also successfully constructed salient critical questions, particularly in regard to weighing values and designing practical creative solutions. In-depth analysis of 1 student showed how conceptual structures and argument practices improved incrementally over time and how the appropriation of stratagems may have been facilitated by the dialectical nature of the intervention (e.g., using critical questions and stratagems successfully in discourse).

Eight Issues for Learning Scientists About Education and the Economy,Roschelle et al.,2011,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Linking research to a compelling societal interest can build financial commitments to research, bring increased attention to findings, and grow support for scaling up impacts. Among many compelling societal interests that learning scientists can cite—such as increasing the quality of life, preparing citizens to make decisions in a complex world, and enhancing social cohesion among a diverse population—economic competitiveness is a compelling societal interest that resonates broadly among stakeholders. Indeed, it is now somewhat common to introduce learning sciences research, as in the Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences and the U.S. National Education Technology Plan, by citing economic rationales. Despite the utility of evoking a potential link between learning research and economic competitiveness in the minds of broader audiences, learning scientists engage in rather little critical discussion of whether such links are meaningful and empirically sound within their own programs of research. This article seeks both to problematize conventional wisdom about links between learning sciences research and economic growth and to suggest possible directions for future research aimed at discovering stronger links. Because the issues are complex, we do not reach firm conclusions.

We consider here e-moderation of synchronous discussions in the school context. We adopt a design research approach to elaborate an environment, the Argunaut system, that fits the reality of classrooms in which moderation of several small-group synchronous discussions in parallel is desirable. We describe the Argunaut system and then describe an experiment in which a moderator could elaborate several strategies in 2 synchronous discussions (1 with 2 groups in parallel and 1 with 4 groups in parallel). Through the technique of cued retrospective reporting, we could identify those strategies and could show how technology and moderation are interwoven. We then assessed whether the actions of the moderator had some positive impact on the flow of the discussions. The positive findings that emerge from this study indicate that teachers can enact this novel practice in classrooms, enabling by such proper guidance for productive engagement in the synchronous discussions of many students in the same class.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2011.553257,,,,,,,,

I review the methodological approaches used by CitationJ. D. Slotta and M. T. H. Chi (2006) to measure ontological commitments and comment on the instructional implications of Chi's theory.

Image Schemas in Clock-Reading: Latent Errors and Emerging Expertise,Gottlieb & Wineburg,2012,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"An embodied view of mathematical cognition should account not only for how we use our bodies to think and communicate mathematically but also how our bodies equip us to conceive of mathematical ideas. Research in cognitive semantics claims that the human conceptual capacity rests on a foundation of image schemas: topological patterns of spatial relations and simple dynamics abstracted from sensorimotor experience. A cognitive ethnography of elementary mathematics lessons in clock-reading reveals different image schemas used to read the hour for landmark times (three o’clock), relative times (a quarter past three), and absolute times (three fifteen). When considered together with the sequence of learning, the image schema analysis predicts the most common error observed in children’s time-telling while also revealing the source of latent errors that lead to sudden breakdowns. Comparison of the image-schematic structure of different levels of sophistication in reading “quarter past” times illustrates how enriched image-schematic structure interrelates different aspects of time-telling, supporting flexible performance in novel situations.

However, the formal expression of these quantities uses a/b analytic metrics; for example, the slope of a line is the quotient of its rise and run. Thus, whereas students’ sensation of an intensive quantity could serve as a powerful resource for grounding its formal expression, accepting the mathematical form requires students to align the sensation with a new way of reasoning about the phenomenon. I offer a case analysis of a middle school student who successfully came to understand the intensive quantity of likelihood. The analysis highlights a form of reasoning called abduction and suggests that sociocognitive processes can guide and mediate students’ abductive reasoning. Interpreting the child’s and tutor’s multimodal action through the lens of abductive inference, I demonstrate the emergence of a proportional concept as guided mediated objectification of tacit perception. This “gestalt first” process is contrasted with traditional “elements first” approaches to building proportional concepts, and I speculate on epistemic and cognitive implications of this contrast for the design and instruction of these important concepts. In particular, my approach highlights an important source of epistemic difficulty for students as they learn intensive quantities: the difficulty in shifting from intuitive perceptual conviction to mediated disciplinary analysis. My proposed conceptualization of learning can serve as an effective synthesis of traditional and reform-based mathematics instruction.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2011.633838,,,,,,,,

Designing for Productive Failure,Reed,2012,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"In this article, we describe the design principles undergirding productive failure (PF; M. CitationKapur, 2008). We then report findings from an ongoing program of research on PF in mathematical problem solving in 3 Singapore public schools with significantly different mathematical ability profiles, ranging from average to lower ability. In the 1st study, 7th-grade mathematics students from intact classes experienced 1 of 2 conditions: (a) PF, in which students collaboratively solved complex problems on average speed without any instructional support or scaffolds up until a teacher-led consolidation; or (b) direct instruction (DI), in which the teacher provided strong instructional support, scaffolding, and feedback. Findings: suggested that although PF students generated a diversity of linked representations and methods for solving the complex problems, they were ultimately unsuccessful in their problem-solving efforts. Yet despite seemingly failing in their problem-solving efforts, PF students significantly outperformed DI students on the well-structured and complex problems on the posttest. They also demonstrated greater representation flexibility in solving average speed problems involving graphical representations, a representation that was not targeted during instruction. The 2nd and 3rd studies, conducted in schools with students of significantly lower mathematical ability, largely replicated the findings of the 1st study.

In this article, we posit “noticing” as a plausible transfer process and investigate both individual noticing and the social organization of noticing via the focusing framework. Specifically, we relate the nature of students' reasoning on transfer tasks with what students notice mathematically in classrooms when many sources of information compete for their attention, and then we account for noticing as socially situated in classroom discourse practices, features of mathematical tasks, and the nature of mathematical activity.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2012.682189,,,,,,,,
Developing and Enacting Pedagogical Content Knowledge for Teaching History: An Exploration of Two Novice Teachers' Growth Over Three Years,Núñez,2012,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Using artifacts of teachers' practices, classroom observations, and teacher interviews, we explore the development and enactment of 2 novices' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) for teaching history. We identify and track 4 components of PCK that are relevant to teaching history: representing history, transforming history, attending to students' ideas about history, and framing history. We find that these 2 novices demonstrated different aspects of PCK in different settings at different points in the first 3 years of their careers. Their PCK continued to grow after preservice education, although the pace and substance of this development varied. In particular, attending to students' ideas about history and framing history were more challenging aspects of PCK for these novices. Specific features of the teacher education program, the school context, and the individual teacher's capacity facilitate growth in PCK, including opportunities to practice, alignment within the teacher education program and across learning sites, reflection on practice, and subject matter knowledge.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2012.742016,,,[method] COMMENTARY;,,,,,

Our starting point for the partnership focused on an 8-hour introductory composites course that was designed for company employees. In phase one, learning scientists observed the company's course development activities and the course as taught by company experts. In phase two, we collaboratively designed and implemented a quasi-experimental study comparing two approaches to teaching. One involved lectures with PowerPoint slides. The second, a “challenge-based” learning approach, combined a set of composites-relevant challenges with individual, small-group, and large-group collaborative inquiry. Comparisons between these methods showed greater interaction among participants in the challenge-based group. In addition, the challenge-based group performed significantly better on posttest items requiring integration and synthesis of concepts. Increased interactivity in the challenge course provided opportunities for participants to articulate connections among concepts and may have contributed to the challenge participants' better synthesis of learned concepts. This work highlighted the benefits for learning scientists of collaborating with industry partners to explore learning in workplace settings, as these settings provide illuminating contrasts to the structures of teaching, learning, and assessment found in schools.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2011.611775,,,[method] ISSUE INTRODUCTION;,,,,,

Achieving Alignment of Perspectival Framings in Problem-Solving Discourse,Bereiter,2012,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"We use a concept of framing to explain 3 cases in which participants initially lacked mutual understanding but then achieved significant mutual understanding. The cases were all consistent with a pattern of positional framing that includes a human participant who is inquiring, which we call a listener, and a source, which may be another human participant or a non-human system. Participants with these different positionings have different perspectives that shape the interpretations and functions of their contributions. We hypothesize that achievement of mutual understanding also depends on participants having epistemological and conceptual framings that are sufficiently aligned. We distinguish between cases in which the participants achieved alignment of conceptual framing by adopting a schema that was in their common ground, cases in which the participants co-constructed a coherent framing without the benefit of a prefabricated schema (by constraint satisfaction, we hypothesize), and cases in which mutual understanding involved a refinement that did not require reframing. We argue that our hypotheses qualify as explanatory mechanisms, and we explicate this in an appendix.Our general goal is to contribute to the growing body of scientific studies that include concepts and methods for understanding cognitive structures and processes integrated with concepts and methods for understanding interaction that people have with each other and with other material and informational systems.

Informing Design Research: Learning From Teachers' Designs of Social Infrastructure,Esmonde,2013,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The design research methodology as it has currently developed centers on the creation of existence proofs, an important first step. What is needed then are the next steps of expanding the methodology to address the design problems of practical implementation prior to the steps involved in scaling up these designs. This article contributes to such an expansion through developing a systematic approach to learning from teachers' enactments of educational models. Design research focused on practical implementations by teachers can create knowledge regarding critical change processes, thus helping to create a theory of trajectories of change, or “implementation paths” (Bielaczyc & Collins, 2006a Collins, Joseph, & Bielaczyc, 2004). Here I propose using the Social Infrastructure Framework (Bielaczyc, 2006) to analyze the design of classroom social structures by developers and teachers in order to better understand their implications for constructing implementation paths. The analytic technique is exemplified through a case study involving a particular team of teachers who worked over the course of several years to adopt a knowledge-building communities approach (Bereiter, 2002; Scardamalia, 2002; Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1991 1994).

The Tailored Practice of Hobbies and Its Implication for the Design of Interest-Driven Learning Environments,Gijlers & Jong,2013,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article seeks to sharpen current conceptualizations of interests and engaged participation, and to derive lessons for the design of interest-driven science learning environments (formal and informal). The empirical basis of the research is a set of ethnographic records of two communities of amateur astronomers, as well as the details of astronomers’ instantiations of the hobby. Hobbies are paradigmatic examples of interest-driven practices and thus they offer an excellent window into truly interest-related phenomena and processes. The analysis and data collection followed a grounded theoretical process, which I describe in two parts. First, I comb through the data iteratively and present a theory of persistent engagement in a hobby practice. Based on this theoretical sketch, I then explain how individuals’ persistent, interest-based pursuit of amateur astronomy is made possible by 4 structural and process features of the practice, which together afford individuals the ability to continuously tailor the hobby: (a) an extensive and varied material infrastructure; (b) participating simultaneously across multiple communities/sites of astronomy practice; (c) activity structural resources that function as templates for short- and long-term activities; and (d) processes of collaboration and idea sharing. Lessons for the design of science learning environments that are truly interest-driven follow.

Exploring the Use of Conceptual Metaphors in Solving Problems on Entropy,Pol et al.,2013,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"A growing body of research has examined the experiential grounding of scientific thought and the role of experiential intuitive knowledge in science learning. Meanwhile, research in cognitive linguistics has identified many conceptual metaphors (CMs), metaphorical mappings between abstract concepts and experiential source domains, implicit in everyday and scientific language. However, the contributions of CMs to scientific understanding and reasoning are still not clear. This study explores the roles that CMs play in scientific problem-solving through a detailed analysis of two physical chemistry PhD students solving problems on entropy. We report evidence in support of three claims: a range of CMs are used in problem-solving enabling flexible, experiential construals of abstract scientific concepts; CMs are coordinated with one another and other resources supporting the alignment of qualitative and quantitative reasoning; use of CMs grounds abstract reasoning in a “narrative” discourse incorporating conceptions of paths, agents, and movement. We conclude that CMs should be added to the set of intuitive resources others have suggested contribute to expertise in science. This proposal is consistent with two assumptions: that cognition is embodied and that internal cognitive structures and processes interact with semiotic systems. The implications of the findings for learning and instruction are discussed.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2012.691926,,,,,,,,
Comparing Learning From Productive Failure and Vicarious Failure,Raes et al.,2013,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"A total of 136 eighth-grade math students from 2 Singapore schools learned from either productive failure (PF) or vicarious failure (VF). PF students generated solutions to a complex problem targeting the concept of variance that they had not learned yet before receiving instruction on the targeted concept. VF students evaluated the solutions generated by PF students before receiving the same instruction. Student-generated solutions were either suboptimal or incorrect, and in this sense can be conceived as failed problem-solving attempts. Although there was no difference on self-reported engagement, PF students reported significantly greater mental effort and interest in knowing the canonical solution to the problem than VF students. When preexisting differences in general ability, math ability, and prior knowledge were controlled, PF students outperformed VF students on conceptual understanding and transfer without compromising procedural fluency. These results suggest that when learning a new math concept, people learn better from their own failed solutions than those of others provided appropriate instruction on the targeted concept is given after the generation or evaluation activity.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2013.819000,,,,,,,,

Learning by Teaching Human Pupils and Teachable Agents: The Importance of Recursive Feedback,Sherin,2013,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Feedback is important for learning. However, there are different types of feedback, and not all feedback is effective. Here we introduce recursive feedback (RF), which occurs when tutors observe their pupils use what they have been taught. Two experiments examined the value of RF during learning by teaching. In the first study adults taught another adult face to face about human biology. Those participants who observed their pupil interact with an examiner exhibited superior learning relative to individuals in several control conditions that included elements of learning by teaching but not RF. The second study examined whether RF benefits extend to teaching computerized teachable agents in regular classrooms. High school students played games in which they induced logical rules. Students taught their agent the governing rules. They received RF when they observed their teachable agent play a prediction game against a second competitor agent. On a posttest, these students exhibited greater abilities to use logic to solve novel problems compared to students in control conditions who received direct feedback by playing against the competitor agent themselves. RF may further generalize to nonteaching situations that also involve a production–appropriation cycle, such as do-it-yourself projects in which people have a chance to learn from how other people take up their handiwork.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2013.807263,,,,,,,,

The use of classroom scaffolding is rare, however. We therefore investigated the benefits to teachers of a professional development program that was based upon a model of contingent teaching (MCT) with the following 4 steps: diagnostic strategies, checking of diagnoses, giving contingent support, and checking of student learning. In our experimental study, 17 of 30 teachers participated in this program. All of the teachers (prevocational education; teaching social studies) taught the same 5-lesson project on the European Union. The frequency and quality of their use of the 4 steps from the MCT were then compared. The teachers who worked with the MCT increased their teaching quality more than the teachers who did not participate, especially with regard to the steps of contingent teaching. They also showed more complete cycles of contingent teaching at postmeasurement than the other teachers. Less successful teachers showed a tendency to provide less support because they mistakenly thought that prompting was not part of scaffolding. Future scaffolding research and professional development efforts aimed at promoting scaffolding can benefit from the MCT, provided that teachers’ understanding of scaffolding is closely monitored.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2013.805300,,,,,,,,
Web-based Collaborative Inquiry to Bridge Gaps in Secondary Science Education,Martin & Sherin,2013,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"As secondary students’ interest in science is decreasing, schools are faced with the challenging task of providing adequate instruction to engage students—and more particularly the disadvantaged students—to learn science and improve their science inquiry skills. In this respect, the integration of Web-based collaborative inquiry can be seen as a possible answer. However, the differential effects of Web-based inquiry on disadvantaged students have barely been studied. To bridge this gap, this study deals with the implementation of a Web-based inquiry project in 19 secondary classes and focuses specifically on gender, achievement level, and academic track. Multilevel analysis was applied to uncover the effects on knowledge acquisition, inquiry skills, and interest in science. The study provides quantitative evidence not only that a Web-based collaborative inquiry project is an effective approach for science learning, but that this approach can also offer advantages for students who are not typically successful in science or who are not enrolled in a science track. This approach can contribute to narrowing the gap between boys and girls in science and can give low-achieving students and general-track students an opportunity to develop confidence and skills for learning science, bringing them to a performance level that is closer to that of high-achieving students.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2013.836656,,,[method] ISSUE INTRODUCTION;,,,,,

From Theory to Data: The Process of Refining Learning Progressions,Wilkerson-Jerde & Wilensky,2013,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Learning progressions (LPs) are theoretical models of how learners develop expertise in a domain over extended periods of time. Recent policy reports have touted LPs as a promising approach to aligning standards, curriculum, and assessment. However, the scholarship on LPs is relatively sparse, and the jury is still out on the theoretical and practical value of this approach. To realize any potential of LPs researchers need to systematically refine these hypothetical models in real-world contexts. Such refinement efforts are challenging, as they require the coordination of messy empirical data with often underspecified theoretical models. Many of the current reports involving the empirical refinement and validation of LPs do not sufficiently explicate the process of how one goes about making modifications to the LP based on empirical data. In this article we present heuristics for facilitating the coordination of data and LP models. Using an illustrative example of a genetics LP and data from a 2-year longitudinal study of this LP, we demonstrate the use of these heuristics to refine the hypothesized levels of the LP. We also discuss the process we used to identify contingencies (relationships) between the constructs of this LP. We conclude with a discussion of implications of the refinement process for the alignment of curriculum, instruction, and assessment.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2012.691924,,,[method] Case Study Research;[method] Interview Methods;,[population] high school;,,,,
A Computational Study of Commonsense Science: An Exploration in the Automated Analysis of Clinical Interview Data,Arvaja,2013,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"A large body of research in the learning sciences has focused on students' commonsense science knowledge—the everyday knowledge of the natural world that is gained outside of formal instruction. Although researchers studying commonsense science have employed a variety of methods, 1-on-1 clinical interviews have played a unique role. The data that result from these interviews take the form of video recordings, which in turn are often compiled into written transcripts and coded by human analysts. In this article, I explore the application of computational techniques to the analysis of this familiar type of data. I describe the success I have had using extremely simple methods from computational linguistics—methods that are based on rudimentary vector space models and simple clustering algorithms. These automated analyses are employed in an exploratory mode as a way to discover student conceptions in the data. The aims of this article are primarily methodological in nature: I attempt to show that it is possible to use techniques from computational linguistics to analyze data from commonsense science interviews in a manner that may provide convergent support for the work of human analysts.

Here we develop and test a Vygotsky-derived hypothesis that postulates playful talk as a mechanism for identity exploration and group status negotiation. Our findings indicate that students utilized the playful talk genre as a means to (a) position themselves and others as more or less competent within the group in order to create or foreclose opportunities to learn, (b) maintain and strengthen bonds that were developing within the group toward the goal of achieving higher levels of coordination and opportunities to learn, and (c) pivot toward a self-selected identity aimed sometimes at affecting one’s status within the group. Taken together, these 3 playful talk functions allowed the group to manage tensions that arose as a result of periods of low coordination and to open opportunities to learn for lower status group members. This study contributes to researchers’ understanding of affective aspects of collaborative learning, which are theorized as foundational to success in such endeavors.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2013.839945,[framework] Design-Based Research (DBR);,[pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR);,[method] Design-Based Research (DBR);[method] RESPONSE;,,,,,

"Patterns, Probabilities, and People: Making Sense of Quantitative Change in Complex Systems",Danish,2014,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The learning sciences community has made significant progress in understanding how people think and learn about complex systems. But less is known about how people make sense of the quantitative patterns and mathematical formalisms often used to study these systems. In this article, we make a case for attending to and supporting connections between the behavior of complex systems, and the quantitative and mathematical descriptions. We introduce a framework to examine how students connect the behavioral and quantitative aspects of complex systems and use it to analyze interviews with 11 high school students as they interacted with an agent-based simulation that produces simple exponential-like population growth. Although the students were comfortable describing many connections between the simulation’s behavior and the quantitative patterns it generated, we found that they did not readily describe connections between individual behaviors and patterns of change. Case studies suggest that these missed connections led students who engaged in productive patterns of sense-making to nonetheless make errors interpreting quantitative patterns in the simulation. These difficulties could be resolved by drawing students’ attention to the graph of quantitative change featured in the simulation environment and the underlying rules that generated it. We discuss implications for the design of learning environments, for the study of quantitative reasoning about complex systems, and for the role of mathematical reasoning in complex systems fluency.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2014.976647,,,,,,,,

Practicality Studies: How to Move From What Works in Principle to What Works in Practice,Lopez et al.,2014,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"In his article “Principled Practical Knowledge: Not a Bridge but a Ladder,” Carl Bereiter (2014) argues that theoretical knowledge is too shallow to support the generation of innovative learning activities. He makes a case for principled practical knowledge (PPK)—“principled know-how and know-why”—to fulfill this practical generative role. We argue and illustrate in this commentary that PPK as portrayed by Bereiter does not offer much practical guidance for 2 potential users: professional designers and teachers. For professional designers PPK should be further specified in order to fulfill its generative role. But even this enriched form of PPK still does not suffice to address the challenging issues of practicality teachers face. We explain the magnitude and dimensions that underlie practicality in the everyday work of teachers and suggest how recent work on fast and frugal heuristics can contribute to helping teachers to make instructional innovations practical.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2014.954751,,,,,,,,
Managing Uncertainty During Collaborative Problem Solving in Elementary School Teams: The Role of Peer Influence in Robotics Engineering Activity,Oeberst et al.,2014,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This study investigated how interaction with peers influenced the ways students managed uncertainty during collaborative problem solving in a 5th-grade class. The analysis focused on peer responses to individuals’ attempts to manage uncertainty they experienced while engaged in collaborative efforts to design, build, and program robots and achieve assignment objectives. Patterns of peer response were established through discourse analysis of work sessions for 5 teams engaged in 2 collaborative projects. Three socially supportive peer responses and 2 unsupportive peer responses were identified. Peer interaction was influential because students relied on supportive social response to enact most of their uncertainty management strategies. This study provides a useful theoretical contribution to understanding the roles of peer interaction in collaborative problem solving. Conceptualizing collaborative problem solving as a process of negotiating uncertainties can help instructional designers shape tasks and relational contexts to facilitate learning.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2014.896254,,,,,,,,

Defining and Operationalizing Appropriation for Science Learning,Roll et al.,2014,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The goal of this article is to contribute to understanding the interplay between students' disciplinary engagement and their identity construction. The term appropriation, borrowed from scholars in linguistics and education, was chosen to capture this broader sense of productive learning that sits at the nexus of disciplinary engagement and identity. Appropriation implies deep conceptual understanding, but it also involves a reflexive process of transforming scientific discourse in a way that is authentic and personal. The core aim of this article is to turn the term appropriation into a theoretical construct by means of an analytic process of defining, operationalizing, and testing the definition against student interview and classroom data. Five discourse markers for operationalizing appropriation were discovered through this process. Appropriation, in our study, implies students’ discourse is (A) an expression of a personal “signature“ idea, (B) grounded in the discipline, (C) thick, in that it involves a metacognitive and epistemological dimension, (D) non-incidental, in the sense of being consistently used throughout classroom activities, and (E) a carrier of social relationships, in that it positions the student within classroom. The study is grounded in an extended intervention on thermodynamics in an Italian secondary school class (grade 12).",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2014.928215,,,,,,,,
The Redirection: An Indicator of How Teachers Respond to Student Thinking,Roth,2014,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Responsive teaching occurs when teachers take up and respond to their students’ ideas during instruction (J. L. Pierson, 2008). Although responsive teaching is gaining recognition as an effective strategy for encouraging student learning, few methods of analysis are capable of characterizing the different ways in which teachers take up their students’ ideas in the moment. This article presents and exemplifies a new methodological construct, the redirection, which provides researchers with a means of detecting nuanced differences in how teachers respond to their students’ thinking. The redirection construct emerged via systematic discourse analysis of 1 science teacher’s classroom discussions during 3 implementations of an inquiry-based module on the water cycle. Redirections are defined as instances when a teacher invites students to shift or redirect their attention to a new locus. Such shifts reflect different types of teacher responsiveness and, as such, can be used to capture the different ways in which teachers take up their students’ ideas. This article presents a comprehensive coding scheme for the redirection, in addition to segments of classroom discourse to exemplify each redirection coding category. A comparison of 3 5th-grade teachers using the construct provides an illustrative example of the type of analysis such a coding scheme affords learning sciences researchers.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2014.930707,,,,,,,,
Conquest or Reconquest? Students’ Conceptions of Nation Embedded in a Historical Narrative,Sengupta-Irving & Enyedy,2014,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article focuses on university students’ understanding of the concept of nation. First an analysis of this concept from a historiographical point of view is presented. This allows for distinguishing between different conceptions of the nation related to 3 main approaches: the romantic, the modernist, and the ethnosymbolic approaches. Based on this analysis and also taking into account present research about history education and the construction of national identities, 5 different dimensions of the concept are presented: (a) historical subject, (b) identification, (c) territory, (d) legitimate claim, and (e) general concept scheme. Qualitative individual interviews were carried out with 31 Spanish college students about a Spanish foundational historical narrative, embedding the concept of nation, called the Reconquest (711 ad–1495 ad). Results indicated that although students showed tensions in their narratives, romantic conceptions dominated most of them. Possible reasons for the existence of these views are analyzed in terms of how the concept of nation is presented in and out of school. Also, implications for teaching and learning this concept are discussed, looking at learning strategies that could improve the understanding of this concept through its 5 analyzed dimensions.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2014.919863,,,,,,,,
Knowledge Construction in Wikipedia: A Systemic-Constructivist Analysis,Sharples et al.,2014,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"We propose a systemic-constructivist perspective for analyzing knowledge construction. In contrast to theories that focus on individuals as actors, the systemic-constructivist approach emphasizes the relevance of social systems and regards the construction of knowledge as a self-referential process that takes place in social systems. We propose that it is the system that defines what is accepted as legitimate knowledge and thus shapes individuals’ behavior. We present this approach and its implications by providing a case study of knowledge construction in Wikipedia. We analyzed the article about the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant shortly after the nuclear catastrophe unfolded. There was a flood of highly uncertain information circulating, which the social system Wikipedia had to deal with and make meaning of. We obtained a group of very diverse people who largely lacked specific background education on the topic but accomplished the collaborative creation of an article that was later considered by experts to be of high quality. By interpreting these occurrences as operations of a social system, we aim to extend the theoretical basis of the learning sciences with an approach that emphasizes systems and their structures instead of individuals or groups. We discuss how this perspective may contribute to understanding collaborative knowledge construction.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2014.888352,,,,,,,,
Design Decisions in Developing Learning Trajectories–Based Assessments in Mathematics: A Case Study,Thompson,2014,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article analyzes the design decisions of a team developing diagnostic assessments for a learning trajectory focused on rational number reasoning. The analysis focuses on the design rationale for key decisions about how to develop the cognitive assessments and related validity arguments within a fluid state and national policy context. The study draws on ethnographic methods adapted from science, technology, and society studies to document key rationales for decisions. For this team, concerns about the validity of both the assessments and the hypothetical trajectory, anticipated uses of the assessments, and the available distribution of resources and expertise to different project activities were all considerations for significant design decisions throughout the project. The study findings suggest that success in the design of trajectories-based assessments depends on teams’ attention to balancing core design activities with engagement in the external policy environment, balancing precision with utility for diagnosis in defining the levels of a trajectory, and balancing the goals of supporting and assessing student learning.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2013.866118,,,,,,,,
On the Benefits of Seeking (and Avoiding) Help in Online Problem-Solving Environments,Van Nguyen et al.,2014,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Seeking the right level of help at the right time can support learning. However, in the context of online problem-solving environments, it is still not entirely clear which help-seeking strategies are desired. We use fine-grained data from 38 high school students who worked with the Geometry Cognitive Tutor for 2 months to better understand the associations between specific help-seeking patterns and learning. We evaluate how students’ help-seeking behaviors on each step in a tutored problem are associated with their success on subsequent steps that require the same skills. Analyzing learning at the skill level allows us to compare different help-seeking patterns within a single student, controlling for between-student variations. Overall, asking for help on challenging steps is associated with productive learning, and overusing help is associated with poorer learning. However, contrary to many help-seeking theories, avoiding help (and failing repeatedly) is associated with better learning than seeking help on steps for which students have low prior knowledge. These results suggest that novice learners may benefit from engaging in solution attempts before they can make sense of given assistance. Methodological benefits for using local measures of learning are discussed, and comparisons are drawn to other forms of productive failure in problem solving.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2014.883977,,,,,,,,
"Learning in the Discovery Sciences: The History of a “Radical” Conceptual Change, or the Scientific Revolution That Was Not",Tabak & Radinsky,2014,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"In this study, I provide a microgenetic-historical account of learning in an informal setting: the conceptual change that occurred while a university-based scientific research laboratory investigated the absorption of light in rod-based photoreceptors of coho salmon, which the “dogma” had suggested to be related to the migration between freshwater and saltwater environments. A morphogenetic, catastrophe theoretic model is proposed and used to structure the account of the conceptual change. The data derive from a 5-year video-based ethnographic study of the laboratory and the fish hatcheries that supplied it with hatchery-raised and wild coho at different developmental stages. Because the scientists collected their data over a 2-year period, slowing down the availability of what they would be saying were their complete data, opportunities arose for studying the conceptual change ethnographically. The study reports difficulties scientists encountered interpreting their data—because they (a) took a dogma-related perspective, (b) had to reconstruct and become familiar with the context from which they had abstracted their specimen, (c) required a biologically relevant rather than mathematically plausible explanation, and (d) exhibited aspect blindness that only disappeared as their familiarity increased.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2014.893435,,,[method] NOTE;,,,,,
Why Engaging in Mathematical Practices May Explain Stronger Outcomes in Affect and Engagement: Comparing Student-Driven With Highly Guided Inquiry,Tabak & Radinsky,2014,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article investigates why students reported liking a student-driven learning design better than a highly guided design despite equivalent gains in knowledge assessments in both conditions. We created two learning designs based on the distinction in the literature between student-driven and teacher-led approaches. One teacher assigned each of her two 5th-grade classes to one design (n = 52); both designs addressed the mathematical concepts for the same amount of time. Data were collected using written assessments, surveys, and video. Students in both classes improved equivalently on assessments. On surveys, students in the student-driven condition were significantly more positive about learning. Video was coded to examine why students were more positive in the student-driven design. This analysis showed students engaging more frequently with data in discussing strategies, questioning peers, and aligning outcomes with prior experiences. We trace the association between students’ positive responses to learning and richer engagement in mathematical practices to specific features of the student-driven design. Furthermore, we reject competing explanations (e.g., amount of off-task behavior or adult intervention). We conclude that designing learning opportunities that promote mathematical practices affords opportunities to cultivate students’ disciplinary interest. We discuss implications for teachers and curriculum designers who are responding to new mathematics standards.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2014.928214,,,[method] NOTE;,,,,,
Personal Inquiry: Orchestrating Science Investigations Within and Beyond the Classroom,Bannister,2014,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"A central challenge for science educators is to enable young people to act as scientists by gathering and assessing evidence, conducting experiments, and engaging in informed debate. We report the design of the nQuire toolkit, a system to support scripted personal inquiry learning, and a study of its use with school students ages 11–14. This differs from previous work on inquiry learning by its emphasis on learners investigating topics of personal significance supported by a computer-based toolkit to guide school pupils through an entire inquiry process that connects structured learning in the classroom with discovery and data collection at home or outdoors. Findings: from the studies indicate that the toolkit was successfully adopted by teachers and pupils in contexts that included teacher-directed lessons, an after-school club, field trips, and learner-managed homework. It effectively supported the transition between individual, group, and whole-class activities and supported learning across formal and informal settings. We discuss issues raised by the intervention studies, including how the combination of technology and pedagogy provided support for the teacher despite difficulties in managing the technology and integrating field data into a classroom lesson.

Engaging Girls’ Sociohistorical Identities in Science,Ghousseini et al.,2014,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"What does it mean for ethnic minority girls, who have historically been marginalized by schools, to “see themselves” in science? Schools fail to create spaces for students to engage their identity resources in the learning of science or to negotiate and enact new science-related identities. This study investigates relationships among identity, engagement, and science discourse and provides a conceptual argument for how and why underserved ethnic minority girls engage in collective identity work, with science learning as a valued byproduct. The primary context for the study was Lunchtime Science, a 4-week lunchtime intervention for girls failing their science courses. There were 4 distinct ways the girls engaged in learning during Lunchtime Science: gleaning content for outside worlds, supporting the group, negotiating stories across worlds, and critiquing science. Each pattern had a signature profile with variations in the sociohistorical narratives used as resources, the positioning of one another as competent learners, and the type of science story critiqued and constructed. These findings indicate that when the girls were given opportunities to engage their personal narratives, and when science was open to critique, ethnic minority girls leveraged common historical narratives to build science narratives. Moreover, the girls’ identity work problematizes the commonplace instructional notion of “bridging” students’ everyday stories with science stories, which often privileges the science story and the composing of “science” identities. It also challenges researchers to investigate how the construction of narratives is broader than 1 community of practice, broader than 1 individual, and broader than 1 generation.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10508406.2014.888351,,,,,,,,

Engaging in Science: A Feeling for the Discipline,Sakr et al.,2015,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Most accounts of affect and motivation in the science education literature have discussed them as relevant to, but distinct from, disciplinary pursuits. These include Pintrich’s seminal work on affective and motivational factors in learning science (P. R. Pintrich, 1999, 2003; P. R. Pintrich & E. De Groot, 1990; P. R. Pintrich, R. W. Marx, & R. A. Boyle, 1993). Our purpose here is to build on those ideas, drawing as well on accounts of scientists’ practices (e.g., H. E. Gruber, 1974; E. F. Keller, 1983) and of students’ taking up of disciplinary pursuits (R. A. Engle & F. R. Conant, 2002; R. Lehrer, 2009; M. Scardamalia & C. Bereiter, 1991, 2006) to propose that affect and motivation are inherent in the disciplinary practices of science. Thus, we introduce notions of epistemic affect and epistemic motivation, and we illustrate how these are evident in a case study of a student we have followed from 4th to 7th grade. We consider how this perspective aligns with and contributes to research on interest (e.g., S. Hidi, 2006; S. Hidi, K. A. Renninger, & A. Krapp, 2004; C. Sansone, 2009), and we discuss implications for research and instruction in science education.

Learning in Equity-Oriented Scale-Making Projects,Sengupta et al.,2015,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article examines how new forms of learning and expertise are made to become consequential in changing communities of practice. We build on notions of scale making to understand how particular relations between practices, technologies, and people become meaningful across spatial and temporal trajectories of social action. A key assumption of our perspective is that the scale relations that give meaning to our actions are not natural but are contested in social, cultural, and political projects. Studying these contentious activities can help us understand the nature of changing participation in dynamic and historically developed practices. Using case materials from 3 groups engaged in the local food justice movement in the western United States, we illustrate their engagement in equity-oriented scale making. Defining features of this work included identifying leverage points within inequitable systems; developing strategies for remediating scale relations to include the perspectives of historically marginalized groups; and coordinating trajectories of practice across settings, activities, and time so that these interventions became increasingly consequential. We conclude with a discussion of the significance of equity-oriented scale making as a lens for organizing design efforts and for studying their implications for nondominant communities.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2015.1004677,,,,,,,,
Learning Fractions by Splitting: Using Learning Analytics to Illuminate the Development of Mathematical Understanding,Sosa et al.,2015,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The struggle with fraction learning in kindergarten through Grade 12 in the United States is a persistent problem and one of the major stumbling blocks to succeeding in higher mathematics. Research into this problem has identified several areas where students commonly struggle with fractions. While there are many theories of fraction learning, none of the research on these theories employs samples large enough to test theories at scale or nuanced enough to demonstrate how learning unfolds over time during instructional activities based on these theories. The work reported here uses learning analytics methods with fine-grained log data from an online fraction game to unpack how splitting (i.e. partitioning a whole into equal-sized parts) impacts learning. Study 1 demonstrated that playing the game significantly improved students’ fraction understanding. In addition, a cluster analysis suggested that exploring splitting was beneficial. Study 2 replicated the learning results, and a cluster analysis showed that compared to early game play, later game play showed more optimal splitting strategies. In addition, in looking at the types of transitions that were possible between a student’s early cluster categorization and later cluster categorization, we found that some types of transitions were more beneficial for learning than others.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2015.1078244,,,,,,,,

Data were collected over a 5-month period. The analysis included the types of sources used in conversation; members’ purpose for invoking and reaction to sources; as well as topic, participation, and response patterns in the discussion forum. The community is a space in which popular culture and the discipline of history meet. Members come together because of a fictional depiction of the past, yet a desire to corroborate, clarify, contextualize, or uncover what really happened leads users to participate in detective-like inquiry work and the learning of new topics they had not previously considered. Members also challenge and critique one another’s positions and the sources other members invoke in multiple ways, including by using more formal disciplinary heuristics in this informal setting. Key differences emerge in members’ purpose for invoking sources, with popular media used more frequently for illustrating a point or asking a question and nonfiction works most invoked to support and argue historical claims.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2015.1112285,,,[method] NOTE;,,,,,

Architects and urban planners share this goal, and the history of their more ambitious designs provides clear examples of how attempts to build the future can turn out. After discussing similarities and differences between design in the learning sciences and design on the scale of buildings and cities, I examine three visionary projects from the modernist era in architecture and urban planning. Each project sought to bring about a radically different and more desirable future, using the most innovative technology and the best ideas of its time. Lessons for learning scientists are drawn from these projects, and suggestions are offered about how architecture scholars can serve as models for learning scientists in how they conceive and study their own efforts to shape a better future.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2015.1094736,,,[method] NOTE;,,,,,
Mobile Experiences of Historical Place: A Multimodal Analysis of Emotional Engagement,Tabak & Radinsky,2015,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article explores how to research the opportunities for emotional engagement that mobile technologies provide for the design and enactment of learning environments. In the context of mobile technologies that foster location-based linking, we make the case for the centrality of in situ real-time observational research on how emotional engagement unfolds and for the inclusion of bodily aspects of interaction. We propose that multimodal methods offer tools for observing emotion as a central facet of person–environment interaction and provide an example of these methods put into practice for a study of emotional engagement in mobile history learning. A multimodal analysis of video data from 16 pairs of 9- to 10-year-olds learning about the World War II history of their local Common is used to illustrate how students’ emotional engagement was supported by their use of mobile devices through multimodal layering and linking of stimuli, the creation of digital artifacts, and changes in pace. These findings are significant for understanding the role of digital augmentation in fostering emotional engagement in history learning, informing how digital augmentation can be designed to effectively foster emotional engagement for learning, and providing insight into the benefits of multimodality as an analytical approach for examining emotion through bodily interaction.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2015.1115761,,,[method] NOTE;,,,,,
Learning to Deflect: Conceptual Change in Physics During Digital Game Play,Tabak & Radinsky,2015,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"How does deep conceptual change occur when students play well-designed educational games? To answer this question, we present a case study in the form of a microgenetic analysis of a student’s processes of knowledge construction as he played a conceptually-integrated digital game (SURGE Next) designed to support learning about Newtonian mechanics. Grounded in the Knowledge In Pieces framework of conceptual change (A. diSessa, 1993), we analyze the processes through which the student, Jamal, developed an expert-like understanding of deflections, a phenomenon that has been previously identified as challenging to understand for novice physics learners. We also explore the key characteristics of SURGE Next supporting these conceptual change processes. Our analysis shows that Jamal’s learning involved iterative refinement of his conceptual understanding through distributed encoding (A. diSessa, 1993). That is, as Jamal advanced through the game levels in SURGE Next, he developed a progressively more distributed sense of mechanism (A. diSessa, 1993) and was able to identify and operationalize the roles of the direction and magnitude of an object’s initial (or previous) velocity in determining the velocity resulting from the application of a new impulse. We also discuss the methodological and design implications of our findings for future research on digital games for learning.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2015.1082912,,,[method] NOTE;,,,,,
Developing Symbolic Interpretation Through Literary Argumentation,Koschmann,2015,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Literature can be a powerful resource for adolescents’ psychosocial development, as it provides opportunities to experience the world through the perspectives of others and juxtapose these with one’s own experiences. However, gaining access to these perspectives requires going beyond literal words on the page to explore interpretive meanings. This mixed-methods case study addresses the need to better understand how adolescent students learn to interpret literary works. Specifically, 9th-grade students participated in a 5-week instructional module focused on symbolic interpretation and coming of age themes in texts with a variety of sources of complexity. The primary data sources were an intentional sample of classroom discussions and essays written before and after instruction. Analyses indicate that students learned to make interpretive claims around symbolism. Textual evidence to support these claims was evident in whole-class discussions but less so in the written essays. Students also struggled to reason about why evidence supported particular claims and how the interpretive claims were related to understanding the characters and their worlds. Discussion focuses on the value of symbolic interpretation as a starting point for engaging adolescents in interpretive practices but notes that developing facility with literary interpretation takes concerted effort over longer periods of time.",http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2015.1124040,,,[method] TRIBUTE;,,,,,

A Transactional Approach to Transfer Episodes,Slakmon & Schwarz,2016,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"In this article we present an analytical framework for approaching transfer episodes—episodes in which participants declare or can be declared to bring prior experience to bear on the current task organization. We build on Dewey’s writings about the continuity of experience, Vygotsky’s ideas of unit analysis, as well as more recent developments in continental philosophy to develop a transactional approach that involves reconceptualizing the notion of experience. In this view, experience is not something that individuals have but an analytical category that denotes the unity of whole persons, their material and social environment, and their changing transactional relations (mutual effects on each other) across time. In the 1st part of the article, we present the theory and contrast it with past and present literature on transfer. In the 2nd part, we develop the methodological implications and analyze an episode of transfer from a technology-enhanced science education curriculum in which students were presented with analogous models of scientific phenomena across different tasks. We describe instances of recognition, of analogical reasoning, and of how students applied theoretical knowledge in terms of transactional units of change. We conclude by discussing implications with regard to further theoretical development and educational practice.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2016.1147449,,,,,,,,
Changing Patterns of Scaffolding and Autonomy During Individual Music Lessons: A Mixed Methods Approach,Takeuchi,2016,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Learning implies change. Inside and outside schools, we aim for students to change into people with more skills and knowledge as well as with a growing sense of agency and responsibility. Furthermore, education itself is subject to constant change. In this article, we examine change in 3 case studies in the context of individual music lessons from a complex dynamic systems approach. Three beginning string instrument students and their teacher were followed for 18 months (28 lessons per dyad) by means of video observations. We combine cluster analyses on longitudinal data with qualitative illustrations of moment-to-moment teacher–student transactions to gain insight into how and why change in teaching and learning occurs. The 3 cases show distinct profiles of change: the development of strong suboptimal attractor states, the emergence of optimal attractor states, and a profile that is characterized by falling back into suboptimal attractor states. We discuss how optimal and suboptimal learning and teaching trajectories can unfold over time and how a mixed methods approach can provide valuable new insights for both practice and future research.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2016.1259624,,,,,,,,
Designing Disruptions for Productive Hybridity: The Case of Walking Scale Geometry,Radinsky & Tabak,2016,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article explores an alternative strategy for designing hybrid instructional environments. Rather than bridging home or community funds of knowledge with school learning, I propose designing disruptions to typical school practices to invite students to recruit out-of-school resources meaningful and sensible to them in order to grapple with school-valued concepts. I examine this design strategy first conceptually, then through a case called walking scale geometry, designed to disrupt the scale of typical classroom geometry. This major disruption has 4 interrelated consequences in that students must invent new tools and strategies for constructing geometry figures, spaces of activity and learning shift, students are positioned with new visual perspectives, and the division of labor is redistributed. I analyze how these 4 consequences played out in an episode of walking scale geometry, in relation to the deployment of student-recruited resources and conceptual agency, then comment on some implications for designing disruptions and hybrid learning settings.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2016.1180297,,,[method] NOTE;,,,,,
Navigating Windows Into Past Human Minds: A Framework of Shifting Selves in Historical Perspective Taking,Radinsky & Tabak,2016,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article presents a framework for understanding historical perspective taking (HPT), the effort to use historical material to explore the internal states of past people. It addresses gaps in HPT research by (a) linking HPT to theories and research from the social science disciplines on perspective taking and the self and (b) proposing a way to analyze how different tasks may elicit different kinds of HPT. The framework is grounded in a study in which 4 young adults thought aloud while taking the perspective of a victim or a perpetrator at the Salem Witch Trials and in a Holocaust-era massacre. Four shifting self perspectives were identified, whereby participants thought as their present-day selves, constructed hypothetical and imagined past selves, and made timeless generalizations about humans. To demonstrate the utility of the framework, I then use it to consider how task characteristics may elicit differential use of the self perspectives. It is argued that close attention to these self perspectives is a novel and crucial way to bring nuance to the concept of HPT, and implications for multiple learning environments are discussed.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2016.1160830,,,[method] NOTE;,,,,,
Concreteness Fading of Algebraic Instruction: Effects on Learning,Radinsky & Tabak,2016,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Learning algebra is difficult for many students in part because of an emphasis on the memorization of abstract rules. Algebraic reasoners across expertise levels often rely on perceptual-motor strategies to make these rules meaningful and memorable. However, in many cases, rules are provided as patterns to be memorized verbally, with little overt perceptual support. Although most work on concreteness focuses on conceptual support through examples or analogies, here we consider notational concreteness—perceptual-motor supports that provide access into the dynamic structure of a representation itself. We hypothesize that perceptual support may be maximally beneficial as an initial scaffold to learning so that later static symbol use may be interpreted using a dynamic perspective. This hypothesis meshes with other findings using concrete analogies or examples, which often find that fading these supports over time leads to stronger learning outcomes. In an experiment exploring this hypothesis, we compared gains from the fading out of dynamic concrete physical motion of symbols during instruction with the introduction of motion over the course of instruction. In line with our theoretical perspective, concreteness fading led to significantly better achievement than concreteness introduction after Day 2 of the intervention.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2016.1250212,,,[method] NOTE;,,,,,

We show that the focus on spatial changes in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environments enriches the scope of activities in virtual environments that are usually studied from the perspective of productivity and disciplinary knowledge building only. We argue that tracing spatial changes enables researchers to scrutinize the freedom to act and exercise power over others, something crucial for the development of political agency. We show that these developments are decisive for students to become competent citizens.

Friendships and Group Work in Linguistically Diverse Mathematics Classrooms: Opportunities to Learn for English Language Learners,Yoon & Aalst,2016,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This ethnographic study examined students’ opportunities to learn in linguistically diverse mathematics classrooms in a Canadian elementary school. I specifically examined the contextual change of group work, which influenced opportunities to learn for newly arrived English language learners (ELLs). Based on analyses of video-recorded interactions, this study revealed a shift in these ELLs’ opportunities to learn from when they worked with teacher-assigned peers to when they worked with friends. In both settings, ELLs tended to be positioned as novices. However, when working with friends, they accessed a wider variety of work practices. In friend groups, ELLs were occasionally positioned as experts and had more opportunities to raise questions and offer ideas. In contrast, when working with teacher-assigned peers, ELLs tended to remain in the position of being helped. In some teacher-assigned groups, interactions were characterized as authoritative, and ELLs’ contributions and ideas were rejected or neglected without relevant justifications or mathematical authority established by their peers. The findings contribute to ongoing discussions on group work and friendship in linguistically diverse classrooms.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2016.1169422,,,[method] NOTE;,,,,,

Learning Along Lines: Locative Literacies for Reading and Writing the City,Philip et al.,2017,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The “everyware” paradigm opens up new possibilities for learning on-the-move with technologies through urban spaces while also raising questions about emerging literacies required of users to understand and use the digital traces these technologies generate. This article develops locative literacies as a way of understanding place-based, digital modes of reading and writing different representational forms at the scale of the city. I explore a new analytic unit, learning along lines, as a tool for supporting the design and analysis of learning contexts where the leading mode of engagement for young learners was physical and digital mobility through the city. Learning along lines emerged from a design study in which youth produced counter-maps of their neighborhood to share with city stakeholders. Using a spatiotemporal framewo rk, I analyze youth learning locative literacies along lines they made of their neighborhood through a designed task, global positioning system (GPS) drawing. First, I focus on young people learning to scale their mobility to a neighborhood grid along lines they made through walking and gesture. Second, I focus on young people learning to negotiate inscriptions along lines they made by walking with maps and GPS devices through their neighborhood. Third, I focus on youth learning to re-member their embodied effort along lines they made discursively during moments of reflection. The analyses are intended to push the field’s understanding of mobility in conceptualizing and designing new forms of learning locative literacies. Learning along lines foregrounds humans not merely as consumers or generators of texts but as being part of that text, literacy agents of a text they populate.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2017.1307198,,,,,,,,

Designing a Bridging Discourse: Re-Mediation of a Mathematical Learning Disability,Ramey & Uttal,2017,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Students with disabilities present a unique instructional design challenge. These students often have qualitatively different ways of processing information, meaning that standard instructional approaches may not be effective. In this study I present a case study of a student with a mathematical learning disability for whom standard instruction on fractions had been ineffective. With regard to theory, I draw on Lev Vygotsky’s framing of disability and then use Anna Sfard’s conceptualization of mathematics as a discourse to design a fraction re-mediation that provided a bridge from the student’s discourse to the canonical mathematics discourse. This bridging discourse was used in 5 videotaped re-mediation sessions with the case study student. A fine-grained analysis of the re-mediation sessions traced the ways in which the student’s discourse shifted over time, which enabled her to solve problems she had previously been unable to solve. This study provides a proof of concept for reconceptualizing remediation and illustrates the potential utility of a bridging discourse to help students who have a history of failure gain access to the canonical mathematics discourse and content.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2016.1256810,,,,,,,,
"Text-Based Argumentation With Multiple Sources: A Descriptive Study of Opportunity to Learn in Secondary English Language Arts, History, and Science",Rienties & Tempelaar,2017,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This study presents a descriptive analysis of 71 videotaped lessons taught by 34 highly regarded secondary English language arts, history, and science teachers, collected to inform an intervention focused on evidence-based argumentation from multiple text sources. Studying the practices of highly regarded teachers is valuable for identifying promising practices and stubborn obstacles to reform. We found that although these highly regarded teachers allocated 3 times more class time to working with text than to teacher lecture and explanation, opportunities to engage in text-based argumentation with multiple sources were rare. Furthermore, less than a 3rd of the time allocated to working with text engaged students in actively making meaning from text. When literacy tasks did occur, they were associated with a disciplinary knowledge focus, challenging the notion that literacy activity occurs at the expense of content instruction. Close reading and cross-textual analysis frequently co-occurred with each other and with argumentation, which suggests that intervention designs should foreground these building blocks of argumentation. Disciplinary differences in opportunity to learn indicate that norms of instruction may carry greater weight than disciplinary norms of reasoning and discourse, which suggests that a particular focus on transforming literacy instruction in science may be warranted.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2016.1256809,,,,,,,,
STEM-Focused Academies in Urban Schools: Tensions and Possibilities,Rubel et al.,2017,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Drawing on data from a study of learning, race, and equity in an urban high school organized around specialized learning academies, we examine the ways in which the design, framing, construction, and organization of learning spaces deeply influences the types of access to rigorous learning that students experience. We draw on the notion of racialized learning pathways to examine access to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning spaces and the ways in which decisions about engaging these learning settings are bound up in notions of race, racial identity, gender, and belonging. We also take up the questions of how researchers and educators can intentionally design for positive racialization toward more inclusive school organization and classrooms. This article contributes to understanding of (a) how learning and identity development are mediated by broader processes of racialization tied to schooling organization and access structures and (b) how racial and gender inequities in STEM can be both reproduced and contested in large urban schools serving racially and socioeconomically diverse students. We contribute to the literature on equity and access in STEM by attending to the racialization processes that we argue are always at work in urban schools, particularly so in schools that are organized into pathways demarcated along racialized lines.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2017.1314215,,,,,,,,
Why Ideology Matters for Learning: A Case of Ideological Convergence in an Engineering Ethics Classroom Discussion on Drone Warfare,Sawyer,2017,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The relationship between ideology and learning remains insufficiently theorized and sparsely investigated in the learning sciences. Drawing on Stuart Hall’s theorization of ideology, Judith Butler’s notion of the (un)grievability of lives, and Sara Ahmed’s construct of stickiness, we illustrate how insights from critical social theory are indispensable to understanding processes of learning and how perspectives from the learning sciences can enrich critical social theory. Through the analysis of a classroom discussion on the use of militarized drones in an undergraduate engineering ethics course, we show how ideological convergence among participants constructed locally significant categories of “civilian,” “terrorist,” and (un)grievability, which narrowed the possible trajectories for students’ disciplinary learning in engineering and engineering ethics. Our analysis also shows that fleeting moments of ideological expansion offered opportunities for new learning; however, most of these instances of possibility were not sustained through the classroom discussion. We explicate how ideological convergences and expansions, as interactional achievements, profoundly matter for disciplinary learning and students’ identities. In conclusion, we explore the implications of our findings for broader contexts of learning and for the field of the learning sciences.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2017.1381964,,,,,,,,
Digital Youth Divas: Exploring Narrative-Driven Curriculum to Spark Middle School Girls’ Interest in Computational Activities,Smirnov et al.,2017,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Women use technology to mediate numerous aspects of their professional and personal lives. Yet, few design and create these technologies given that women, especially women of color, are grossly underrepresented in computer science and engineering courses. Decisions about participation in STEM are frequently made prior to high school, and these decisions are impacted by prior experience, interest, and sense of fit with community. Digital Youth Divas is an out-of-school program that uses narrative stories to launch the creation of digital artifacts and support non-dominant middle school girls’ STEM interests and identities through virtual and real-world community. In this article, we discuss the framework of the Digital Youth Divas environment, including our approach to blending narratives into project-based design challenges through on- and offline mechanisms. Results from our pilot year, including the co-design process with the middle school participants, suggest that our narrative-centered, blended learning program design sparks non-dominant girls’ interests in STEM activities and disciplinary identification, and has the potential to mediate girls’ sense of STEM agency, identities, and interests.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2017.1307199,,,,,,,,
Making Sense of Space: Distributed Spatial Sensemaking in a Middle School Summer Engineering Camp,Thadani et al.,2017,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Spatial thinking is important for success in engineering. However, little is known about how students learn and apply spatial skills, particularly in kindergarten to Grade 12 engineering learning. The present study investigated the role of spatial thinking in engineering learning at a middle school summer camp. Participants were 26 students (13 female, 13 male), predominantly from underrepresented groups. We took a cognitive ethnographic approach, using observations of hands-on engineering learning activities to identify moments when spatial problems arose and how learners made sense of these problems. We describe these processes as distributed spatial sensemaking because they involved both internal (cognitive) processes and also interactions with other learners, materials, and representations. We identified 90 distributed spatial sensemaking episodes in our data set. These episodes facilitated important engineering practices such as hypothesis testing and design iteration. We also found that different activities elicited different types of distributed spatial sensemaking episodes. Our results demonstrate how spatial thinking matters in everyday engineering learning and speaks to the types of engineering learning activities that scaffold particular spatial processes and practices. Our research also shows how cognitive, situated, and distributed theories can be used in tandem to make sense of a complex phenomenon like engineering learning.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2016.1277226,,,,,,,,
Turning Groups Inside Out: A Social Network Perspective,Turner et al.,2017,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Most research related to learning in groups focuses on the unit of the group and/or group members. However, students may benefit from crossing the boundaries of their own group, as students in different groups may provide access to new, nonredundant knowledge and opportunities for learning. Whether boundary crossing between groups is beneficial for learning and academic performance has received limited conceptual and empirical attention. Using social network analysis and structural equation modeling, we contrasted pre/post network developments among 693 students (132 groups) across 4 modules at a UK business school. We examined whether it is better for students to invest in social relations in groups to learn and enhance academic performance or to (continue to) invest in social relations outside groups. Our findings indicated that students seemed to learn more from learning relations outside their group than from their own group members. Students with more intergroup relative to intragroup learning relations performed better on module assessments and throughout the academic year than students with more intragroup learning relations. Boundary crossing and intergroup learning deserves more empirical attention and experimentation on how to balance boundary crossing and effective group learning strategies.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2017.1398652,,,,,,,,
Making Space for Place: Mapping Tools and Practices to Teach for Spatial Justice,Van Horne & Bell,2017,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article presents a set of spatial tools for classroom learning about spatial justice. As part of a larger team, we designed a curriculum that engaged 10 learners with 3 spatial tools: (a) an oversized floor map, (b) interactive geographic information systems (GIS) maps, and (c) participatory mapping. We analyze how these tools supported learning using notions of politicization. The floor map fed conceptual understandings of the map as a representational text and served as the terrain for an embodied activity to support proportional reasoning about inequitable distributions of resources. The data-rich GIS maps and their zoomability allowed for coordinating across multiple variables to connect patterns in inequities to other social processes. The participatory mapping enabled learners to make discoveries about, connect, and share beyond the individual classroom counterstories from people in the lived streets of their neighborhood.

Teaching and Learning How to Create in Schools of Art and Design,Walsh & Tsurusaki,2017,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article describes the studio model—a cultural model of teaching and learning found in U.S. professional schools of art and design. The studio model includes the pedagogical beliefs held by professors and the pedagogical practices they use to guide students in learning how to create. This cultural model emerged from an ethnographic study of two professional schools of art and design. A total of 38 professors from a total of 15 art disciplines and design disciplines were interviewed and their studio classes were observed. A grounded theory analysis was used to allow the studio model to emerge from audio recordings of interviews and video recordings of studio classes. The model was then validated by 16 different professors at six additional art and design schools. The studio model was found to be general across art and design disciplines and at all eight institutions. The central concept of the studio model is the creative process, with three clusters of emergent themes: learning outcomes associated with the creative process, project assignments that scaffold mastery of the creative process, and classroom practices that guide students through the creative process.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2017.1381963,,,,,,,,
Infrastructuring Distributed Studio Networks: A Case Study and Design Principles,Lee,2017,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Design educators have long used studio-based learning environments to create communities of learners to support authentic learning in design. Online social media platforms have enabled the creation of distributed studio networks (DSNs) that link studio-based learning environments into expanded communities of practice and potential networked improvement communities. As learning scientists, we do not adequately understand how to infrastructure learning and resource sharing across distributed studios. In this ethnography of the infrastructure of Design for America, a DSN, we analyzed data from interviews, online communication, and field observations as the organization grew its network of university design studios. We found that Design for America managers faced challenges of providing support and resources to address wide variation in needs across studios. Lacking an existing comprehensive network collaboration platform, managers created a proto-infrastructure to distribute support across studios. By studying their iterative adoption of communication and collaboration tools and organizational routines, we define a unique set of design principles to infrastructure DSNs: (a) surfacing local progress and problems, (b) affective crowding, (c) solution mapping, and (d) help routing. Assembling constellations of tools and designing platforms based on these principles could support learning in and the improvement of DSNs across domains.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2017.1409119,,,[method] COMMENTARY;,,,,,
What Can a Cognitive Coding Framework Reveal About the Effects of Professional Development on Classroom Teaching and Learning?,McKenney,2017,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"We investigated what a cognitive framework for measuring classroom teaching could reveal about (a) the impact of a professional development (PD) program on teaching practices and (b) the relationship between teaching practices and student science learning. To conduct this study, we leveraged a collaboration between two entirely independent projects. The first project had developed a framework, the Teacher Tasks and Questions (TTQ) coding framework, for measuring teaching. The second project, the Science Teachers Learning From Lesson Analysis (STeLLA-1) project, possessed a rich body of teaching and student learning data. The two projects’ independence from each other allowed us to examine the generalizability of the TTQ framework and to investigate its validity. The TTQ measures were applied to the data set from the STeLLA-1 project. We examined whether the TTQ measures detected meaningful changes in teaching practice from pre-PD to post-PD and whether they predicted student learning. We found that the TTQ measures did detect changes in teaching practices that were consistent with STeLLA-1’s aims; furthermore, some TTQ measures also predicted student learning. We discuss the value of having generalizable measurement frameworks that can be used across different studies. We also glean lessons about data sharing across independent projects.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2017.1396220,,,[method] EDITORIAL;,,,,,
The Development of Professional Learning Communities and Their Teacher Leaders: An Activity Systems Analysis,Yoon & Hmelo-Silver,2017,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Professional learning communities can be effective vehicles for teacher learning and instructional improvement, partly because they help change professional culture. However, little is known about how these changes occur. We used activity systems analysis to investigate the development of professional learning communities and their teacher leaders (N = 9) based on interviews and observations over 2 years. Activity systems analysis enables researchers to understand change within complex qualitative data sets by finding systemic relations within the activity, specifying contradictions in the system, and explicating outcomes. The resulting activity system illuminates the transformation of a mostly private, autonomous, and egalitarian culture to one of nascent collaboration, reflection, and shared values, as well as teacher leaders’ development of agency.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2017.1381962,,,[method] Descriptive Statistics;[method] Surveys;,,,,,

“Thank You for Being Republican”: Negotiating Science and Political Identities in Climate Change Learning,Hall,2017,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"When engaging with socioscientific issues, learners act at the intersection of scientific, school, and other societal communities, drawing on knowledge, practices, and identities from both in and out of the classroom to address problems as national or global citizens. We present three case studies of high school students whose classroom participation in a unit on the politically polarizing topic of climate change was informed by their political identities and how they situated themselves in climate change’s sociocultural, historical, and geologic context. We describe how these students, including two who initially rejected human-influenced climate change but revised their understandings, negotiating dissonant identities in the classroom through repeated engagement with conflicting political and scientific values, knowledge, and beliefs. These case studies problematize building bridges between formal and informal learning experiences and suggest that it may be necessary to leverage disconnections in addition to building connections across settings to promote productive identity work. The results further suggest that supporting climate change learning includes attending to identity construction across ecosocial timescales, including geologic time.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2017.1362563,,,,,,,,

Inquiry as a Members’ Phenomenon: Young Children as Competent Inquirers,Pol et al.,2018,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Understanding children’s inquiry often draws on exogenous understanding (i.e., scientists’ inquiry, classroom expectations) without first understanding inquiry in children’s everyday lives. In contrast, we examine young children’s inquiry in their families to better understand their competent engagement in inquiry. Specifically, we develop an endogenous representation of inquiry as a members’ phenomenon (IMP)—a representation formulated by participants in the course of their own activity. IMP highlights key moments in inquiry—beginning by orienting to inquiry, making progress by drawing on sensemaking resources, and orienting to ending inquiry. This representation also allows us to recognize evidence of young children’s competence in managing interactional, affective, and epistemic challenges inherent in these key moments of inquiry; the diverse array of sensemaking resources through which children address those challenges; and a range of children’s interests and concerns addressed within their inquiry. Furthermore, IMP provides a prism for reconceptualizing learning from learners’ perspective: attending to how participants orient to a moment of inquiry, inquire together, and come to what counts to them as a satisfactory end to their inquiry. This representation of inquiry is an important step in basic learning sciences research and informative for the design of science and other domain learning environments.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2018.1528448,,,,,,,,
Identifying Essential Epistemic Heuristics for Guiding Mechanistic Reasoning in Science Learning,Ruiz-Gallardo & Reavey,2018,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Mechanistic reasoning, or reasoning systematically through underlying factors and relationships that give rise to phenomena, is a powerful thinking strategy that allows one to explain and make predictions about phenomena. This article synthesizes and builds on existing frameworks to identify essential characteristics of students’ mechanistic reasoning across scientific content areas. We argue that these characteristics can be represented as epistemic heuristics, or ideas about how to direct one’s intellectual work, that implicitly guide mechanistic reasoning. We use this framework to characterize middle school students’ written explanatory accounts of two phenomena in different science content areas using these heuristics. We demonstrate evidence of heuristics in students’ accounts and show that the use of the heuristics was related to but distinct from science content knowledge. We describe how the heuristics allowed us to characterize and compare the mechanistic sophistication of account construction across science content areas. This framework captures elements of a crosscutting practical epistemology that may support students in directing the construction of mechanistic accounts across content areas over time, and it allows us to characterize that progress.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2018.1510404,,,,,,,,
Using Everyday Language to Support Students in Constructing Thematic Interpretations,Russ & Berland,2018,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Research in literary response indicates that in classroom contexts, high school students have difficulty constructing thematic interpretations of literary texts, tending instead to summarize or build happiness-bound morals that ignore a text’s potentially negative tones. However, studies in out-of-school contexts show students building thematic interpretations that include positive and negative elements. These conflicting findings suggest that some challenges of thematic interpretation lie not in students’ interpretive limitations but in school-based discourses that define thematic interpretation. In this study, students constructed thematic interpretations with sentence stems using everyday interpretive language, such as “Reading this story suggests the world can be a place where _____.” With no additional instruction, experimental groups constructed more thematic interpretations and made fewer happiness-bound interpretations than a comparison group. Results suggest that students are more capable of thematic interpretation than some research indicates and that everyday interpretive language may help disrupt students’ school-based framing of thematic interpretation.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2018.1485023,,,,,,,,
Finding the Best Types of Guidance for Constructing Self-Explanations of Subgoals in Programming,Santagata et al.,2018,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Subgoal learning, a technique used to break down problem solving into manageable pieces, has been used to promote retention and transfer in procedural domains, such as programming. The primary method of learning subgoals has been passive, and passive learning methods are typically less effective than constructive methods. To promote constructive methods of learning subgoals, we prompted learners to self-explain the subgoals of a problem-solving procedure. Self-explanation asks learners to make sense of new information based on prior knowledge and logical reasoning. Novices’ self-explanation is typically more effective when they receive guidance, because it helps them to focus on relevant information. In the present experimental study, the types of guidance that students received while self-explaining determined whether the constructive learning method was more effective than the passive method. Participants assigned to the constructive learning method performed best when they either received hints about the subgoals or received correct explanations as feedback, but not when they received both. These findings suggest that constructive learning of subgoals can further improve the benefits of subgoal learning when students receive only guidance that complements their construction of knowledge. This nuance is important for educators who engage their students in constructive learning and self-explanation.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2018.1491852,,,,,,,,

The data consist of 30 videotaped home care visits. The learning cycles of the encounters were found to be either predominantly defensive or expansive, which led to the identification of 4 basic types of combined learning cycles. Encounters in which the client’s and the worker’s cycles were aligned tended to contain fewer learning actions than encounters in which the cycles moved to opposite directions. The latter types of encounters were characterized by subtle orientational mismatches that left matters open and invoked further elaboration by the client and the worker. Defensive cycles were more reflective than expected and seemed to involve aspects of agency that are not commonly acknowledged.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2017.1412970,,,,,,,,
Scaffolding Student Understanding in Small-Group Work: Students’ Uptake of Teacher Support in Subsequent Small-Group Interaction,Wilkerson & Polman,2018,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Providing contingent or adaptive support (i.e., scaffolding) is effective. Yet it is unclear how it promotes students’ learning. In this mixed-methods study, we investigated to what extent the effect of contingent support for students’ learning is mediated by the extent to which students take up teachers’ support in subsequent small-group work. We define contingent support as support that contains adapted levels of teacher control or regulation based on the learner’s level of understanding. To explore the research question, we analyzed all interactions from 35 lessons of 7 secondary social studies teachers and 7 small groups of students. Logistic multilevel mediation analyses showed that the likelihood of students formulating accurate answers during small-group work was higher when students applied the teacher’s support in subsequent small-group work (as opposed to ignoring that support). However, the contingency of a teacher’s support did not affect students’ uptake or the accuracy of their answers. Additional qualitative analyses showed that students’ uptake of contingent support was sometimes hampered by untimely fading of the support. Moreover, we found that contingent support that was then gradually faded was the most effective in fostering students’ uptake of a teacher’s support.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2018.1522258,[framework] Situated Cognition;,,,[technology] data science tools;,,,,
Learning Science Concepts by Teaching Peers in a Cooperative Environment: A Longitudinal Study of Preservice Teachers,Calabrese Barton & Tan,2018,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Misconceptions of science principles are frequent among university students. This is particularly problematic in teacher education, as these misconceptions can be passed on by teachers to pupils at school. In this study, 40 preservice teachers studied 8 common misconceptions by 3 different approaches: learning by teaching (LbT) and learning from peers (LfP; both organized in cooperative groups and using self-developed activities) and conventional lecturing. Participants’ understanding was evaluated prior to, 1 month after, and 2 years after instruction, together with their views on the effectiveness of these methods for achieving learning. The 3 approaches improved scores on all posttests, but LbT achieved the best results. This coincided with perceptions of the participants who gave diverse reasons for the success of LbT. For lecturing, the longitudinal perspective showed that gains in student learning at 1 month had partially declined by 2 years, even though there was still a medium effect size compared to the pretest. However, for LbT and LfP gains remained statistically stable throughout. A combination of these methods might not only contribute efficiently to conceptual change for a good number of misconceptions but also connect teacher education to an almost real school classroom, giving opportunities to translate student learning into teaching practice.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2018.1506988,[framework] Critical Theory;[framework] Design-Based Research (DBR);,[pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR);[pedagogy] Equity Pedagogy;,[method] Critical Theory;[method] Design-Based Research (DBR);,[setting] classrooms;[subject] STEM;,belonging;identity;interest;,,,

We use an analogy to the domain of spelling to introduce invented science—a framework for describing the activity of science learning that reduces this slippage by giving knowledge construction true priority over the canon.

The course centers on systematic reflection and analysis of practice intended to foster career-long learning. We then examine the impact of this course on several facets of learning-from-teaching competencies, including teacher knowledge, beliefs, and practices. Sixty-two preservice teachers enrolled in a one-year post-bachelor elementary teacher preparation program were randomly assigned to attend this course or a more typical mathematics methods course. Findings: suggest that teacher preparation experiences centered on systematic reflection and analysis create opportunities to develop certain aspects of learning-from-teaching competencies that remain otherwise underdeveloped.

In this document analysis of the websites of 75 international graduate learning sciences programs, we examine central concepts and research methods across institutions, compare the programs, and assess the homogeneity of different subgroups. Results reveal that the concepts addressed most frequently were real-world learning in formal and informal contexts, designing learning environments, cognition and metacognition, and using technology to support learning. Among research methods, design-based research (DBR), discourse and dialog analyses, and basic statistics stand out. Results show substantial differences between programs, yet programs focusing on DBR show the greatest similarity regarding the other concepts and methods they teach. Interpreting the similarity of the graduate programs using a community of practice perspective, there is a set of relatively coherent programs at the core of the learning sciences, pointing to the emergence of a discipline, and a variety of multidisciplinary and more heterogeneous programs “orbiting” the core in the periphery, shaping and innovating the field.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2018.1440353,,,,,,,,

The learning sciences is uniquely positioned to investigate how such contextual embeddings impact learners’ engagement with data including conceptual, experiential, communal, racialized, spatial, and political dimensions. This special issue demonstrates the richly layered relationships learners build with data and reveals them to be not merely utilitarian mechanisms for learning about data, but a critical part of navigating data as social text and understanding Data Science as a discipline.

Drawing on theories of consequential learning and critical justice, we analyze ethnographic data from 3 urban middle school classrooms in 2 states during a STEM unit focused on engineering for sustainable communities. Findings: describe 2 making present practices students enacted as they engaged in engineering design: modeling ethnographic data and reperforming injustices toward solidarity building. We discuss how these practices supported moments of rightful presence in the STEM classrooms by inscribing youths’ marginalizing school experiences as a part of classroom science discourse and co-opting school science tasks as tools for exposing, critiquing, and addressing these unjust experiences.

This essay makes three points: (a) Stokes had a broader view that also considered the temporal flow between and among the different cells in his famous diagram; (b) Stokes argued against the relative valuation of either type of research (basic or applied); and (c) the learning sciences currently contain exemplars of all four of the cells in Stokes’s famous 2 × 2 matrix, and this diversity has enriched the field, and can continue to do so, as long as work in Pasteur’s quadrant is not viewed as the only worthwhile type of learning sciences research.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2019.1570517,,,,,,,,
How Children Individualize Numerical Routines: Elements of a Discursive Theory in Making,Walkoe & Luna,2019,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Conceptualizing numbers as discursive constructs generated in, and for the sake of, communication, we investigated the development of the numerical discourse of Milo, a boy who was 2 years and 8 months old when we first met him and whom we then followed for 18 months. Our analyses of the child’s evolving responses to the question “Where is there more X?” (WiTM) corroborated the basic theoretical tenet, according to which numerical thinking begins in our culture with the independent appearance of (1) the quantitative–non-numerical discourse and (2) numerical–non-quantitative discourse. In Milo’s case, these two discourses, although constantly evolving, remained separate for months. A number of clearly distinguishable developments preceded the eventual consolidation of the independent numerical and quantitative “rituals” the child performed in response to WiTM-question into one compound routine of quantitative–numerical comparison. It is at this point that the numerical and quantitative ways of thinking began coalescing into a single discourse and the initial binary relation of order gave rise to the unary relation of cardinality. All this is summarized in a three-stage model of the development of numerical discourse. Three additional case studies that corroborated this model are reported briefly.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2019.1646650,,,,,,,,

We analyze coordination work between family members and others involved in the care of children with T1D using the lens of distributed cognition, and we introduce the notion of a data catchment to refer to the pathways of data flow and information storage within and between multiple agents and spaces. Interviews and observations reveal three main features of storage and use in data catchments: First, there is a great variability in how data move and are retained to enable communication between family members and others. Second, families tended to focus more on individual data points and less on aggregate readings despite some indications of ability to narrate through aggregate readings. Third, families engage in recurrent conversations and sometimes use novel artifacts to make numerical values meaningful to children with T1D. Implications for understanding this space of practice as constituting a data catchment are discussed.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2019.1666011,,,[method] REPORT;,,,,,
Primary Grade Children’s Capacity to Understand Microevolution: The Power of Leveraging Their Fruitful Intuitions and Engagement in Scientific Practices,Vossoughi et al.,2019,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"We investigated second and third graders’ capacity to understand microevolution, given a learning progression leveraging intuitions to build more adequate explanations, problematizing core ideas within scientific practices, and in-depth study of a single domain (botany or animal behavior). The intervention was implemented in both researcher-taught summer school and regular school-year classrooms in two consecutive years, allowing refinement of instruction mid-course, as well as comparison of learning outcomes. A case study examined how the pedagogy functioned within a strategically selected segment of curriculum enactment. Analysis of pre- and post-instruction interviews, using mean scaled estimates and maximum learning progression levels, revealed significant conceptual advancements for all cohorts across both sites and years. After Year I, a majority of children in researcher-taught and regular classrooms could predict and explain the impact of traits’ differential survival advantage on next-generation shifts in relative frequency given particular environmental change. After Year II, the majority in each cohort formed normative predictions and explanations of population changes across multiple generations. This pattern reflects a basic understanding of microevolution, providing evidence of the capacity of primary grade children to understand abstract ideas and, more generally, to benefit from much more conceptually and epistemically ambitious curriculum than current science standards recommend.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2019.1667806,[framework] Embodied Cognition;,,[method] Ethnography;[method] Interaction Analysis;,,access;,,,
Authoring Data Stories in a Media Makerspace: Adolescents Developing Critical Data Literacies,Vea,2019,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"This article centers sociocultural and sociopolitical considerations of how young people understand, represent, and use data by presenting findings from a social design research study about how students in a public urban high school authored “data stories” using personal data they curated, collected, and visualized. The study contributes to theoretical understandings of critical data literacies by considering the experiences and practices of adolescents enrolled in a required media arts class as they produced data visualizations drawn from their everyday lives. Findings: center on two aspects of critical data literacies youth developed—understanding themselves as people capable of using data for multiple purposes and understanding data as socially situated resources for meaning-making. This study foregrounds the importance of positioning youth as authors and architects of data, making central youth perspectives in understanding the role of data in young people’s digitally connected lives and highlighting the importance of expanding what “counts” as data. It also suggests the importance of creating infrastructure to support the development of culturally relevant data practices that highlight the social, cultural, and political uses of data and its racialized dimensions.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2019.1689365,[framework] Activity Theory;[framework] Sociocultural Theory;,,[method] Ethnography;[method] Interview Methods;,[subject] activism;,affect;efficacy;emergent reasoning;power;,,,
Scripts and Counterscripts in Community-Based Data Science: Participatory Digital Mapping and the Pursuit of a Third Space,Wisittanawat & Gresalfi,2019,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Data increasingly mediates how we understand the world. As such, there is growing interest in designing initiatives to help young people learn about data—not only the techno-mathematical skills necessary to work with data, but also the dispositions needed to participate in data-centric ways of knowing and doing. In this article, we argue that as this educational goal is pursued, it is important to attend to the normative scripts that are often associated with data, and how they relate to learners’ perspectives and prior experiences. We do this by examining two initiatives that aimed to help young people learn about data and its “real-world” applications by engaging them in participatory mapping activities, directed toward the study of local community challenges. We argue that when there are mismatches between students’ realities and how reality is described to work in data science, making the time and space to examine these contradictions can lead to a robust engagement with data science and its applications. These findings have implications for how we might better design tools and learning activities that connect data science with the broader contexts that frame young people’s lives.",https://doi.org/10.1080/10508406.2019.1693378,[framework] Situated Learning;,,[method] Case Study Research;[method] Frame Analysis;[method] Interaction Analysis;[method] Multimodal Analysis;,[population] middle school;[subject] mathematics;[technology] games;,identity;perspective taking;play;teamwork;,,,
"What We are Missing in Studies of Teacher Learning: A Call for Microgenetic, Interactional Analyses to Examine Teacher Learning Processes",Boelens et al.,2019,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Much of the work in the Learning Sciences and Computer-Supported Collaborated Learning communities have focused on understanding and designing for learning in collaborative spaces. This work utilizes methods such as Interaction Analysis and has attended to multiple dimensions and timescales of learning. It has redefined ideas about knowledge and competence and how they are acquired, thus providing important insights into the process of learning and the design of learning environments. However, we have not in the same way advanced our knowledge of teacher learning. Our understanding of the process and mechanism of teacher learning in in collaborative professional development (PD) environments is still quite thin. In this paper, we discuss how utilizing methods from Interaction Analysis, in particular, can offer insight into the process of teacher learning in these contexts. We illustrate how adopting a lens that shifts away from asking whether teachers are progressing toward a researcher-defined goal, toward one that asks how learning occurs in the moments of interaction, and the meaning it has for participants as they work to achieve PD goals, has the potential to shed new light on learning in teacher PD.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2019.1681998,[framework] Design-Based Research (DBR);,[pedagogy] Conjecture Mapping Framework;[pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR);,[method] Case Study Research;[method] Conjecture Mapping;[method] Design-Based Research (DBR);,[population] adult learners;[subject] vocational education;,safety;,,,

Infrastructuring refers to activities that aim to redesign components, relations, and routines of schools and districts that influence what takes place in classrooms. It can take place within ongoing, long-term research–practice partnerships, where teams can follow the contours of problems that arise from introducing innovations into classrooms, particularly as they relate to equity of implementation of those innovations.

Embodied Pathways and Ethical Trails: Studying Learning in and through Relational Histories,Chen et al.,2020,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Studies of embodied cognition offer powerful accounts of the semiotic resources people use as they think together within different domains. Yet this research does not typically foreground the history of relationships within focal interactions—a history we have found to be consequential to the ways embodied actions unfold. Through ethnographic and interactional analysis of the assistance students received in a tinkering afterschool program and the forms of assistance they enacted over time, we show how children supported one another using embodied movements that were embedded in relational histories and imbued with pedagogical and ethical values. We substantiate these findings by introducing the range of embodied movements identified within the setting, followed by a detailed analysis of three cases spanning distinct time-scales (5 minutes, 1 week, 3 years). The cases help establish the construct of embodied pathways, which we define as courses of possible action involving participants’ bodies and voices that model particular relations. We argue that the experience of receiving embodied assistance creates resources for mediation in the future, as seen in subsequent acts of guidance and solidarity across children. More broadly, we argue for greater attention to how people learn to be in relation within research on embodied learning.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2019.1693380,,,,,,,,
The learning of emotion in/as sociocultural practice: The case of animal rights activism,Freedman,2020,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: : Learning sciences researchers, including those in the sociocultural tradition, often address emotion on motivation’s terms, as a condition or quality of being that propels or mediates learning activity. Other times, emotion remains implicit in analyses of learning. Methods: : Toward a more robust theorization of the relationship between learning and emotion, I present a sociocultural analysis of ethnographic fieldnotes and interviews with animal rights activists. Findings: : I present a sociocultural practice view on emotion, introducing “emotional configurations” to denote how emotion, rather than comprising universal and internal states, only becomes meaningful through entanglement with sense-making and situated practice in social activity. Analysis reveals two modes for emotion in learning: (1) as a condition of learning that drives learning along and (2) as a target of teaching and learning in its own right. I name “guided emotion participation” as a genre of activity that approaches emotional configurations as a learning target. Contribution: : Integrating sociocultural practice theory with emotion research provides new tools for analyzing emotion in learning. This study highlights how emotion is subject to norms, ideology, and power relations. For researchers studying the politics of learning, this study demonstrates how emotion shapes political possibilities and collective action as learning phenomena.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2020.1748036,,,,,,,,
The “tricky business” of genre blending: Tensions between frames of school mathematics and video game play,Goulding,2020,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: : Educational video games are increasingly used in classrooms because they can offer meaningful contexts for problem solving. However, educational video games bring together two historically disparate activities: school mathematics and video games. How these two activities complement, compromise, or contradict each other influences how mathematical activity takes shape during game play. Methods: : This paper offers a case analysis of two students: one who engages with the mathematics as intended by the game and is easily seen as on task, and a second who seems to reject the mathematics as intended by the game and is easily seen as off task. The analysis focuses on how each student’s frame of activity influences their mathematical activity during game play. Findings: : Findings suggest that, considered from their own frame of activity instead of the frame of the design, both students appear engaged in mathematical sensemaking, albeit in different ways: one as intended by the designer, the other as emerging from game play. Contribution: : By highlighting potential tensions between these official and unofficial frames, this paper contributes to continued reflections on task designs that incorporate youth culture such as video gaming to make mathematics classrooms more inviting to students.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2020.1817747,,,,,,,,

Latino immigrants in civil society: Addressing the double-bind of participation for expansive learning in participatory budgeting,Takeuchi & Aquino Ishihara,2020,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: The author discusses an in-depth study of the participatory budgeting process in Chicago’s 49th Ward (PB49), a deliberative democratic process in which all residents and ideas were positioned as equal, relying on rational arguments to make decisions about municipal funding allocations. The study documented collective decision-making practices as they related specifically to predominantly Spanish-speaking Latino immigrants.MethodsUtilizing an expanded cultural-historical activity theory interventionist framework, the study examined two iterations of the PB49 process. The author combines two discourse analysis methods to identify participants’ learning over time and events, beyond the individual level.FindingsThe study identified moments of systemic contradictions that either challenged or supported the inclusion and engagement of Latino participants in the PB49 process. The findings revealed the double-bind of diversifying participation in the PB49 process.ContributionThe study shows that expansive learning comprises two distinct levels—collective and system-level learning—though it can occur collectively without materializing at the system level.

Shifting education reform towards anti-racist and intersectional visions of justice: A study of pedagogies of organizing by a teacher of Color,Uttamchandani,2020,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: : Social movement scholarship tends to focus on macro-level processes of movement emergence, overlooking the day-to-day groundwork of marginalized social movement actors who contribute to and sustain large-scale action. Contributing to this gap in literature, we develop the construct of “pedagogies of organizing” to illuminate the micro-level dimensions through which social movements for educational justice emerge.Methods: Drawing on audio/video recordings, field notes, and artifacts as data, we examine the micro-interactional processes through which a teacher of Color, as union organizer, facilitates common cause and identity among teachers, students, and working people as social movement actors in the 2019 Los Angeles teacher strike.Findings: Our analysis details how broad-based social movements and teacher union’s organizing strategies influenced his practices. Guided by ethnic studies and third world feminism, this teacher simultaneously engaged multiple contexts—sometimes at tension with one another—to (re)create organizing strategies that sustained collective action and (re)centered anti-racist intersectional visions of educational justice.Contribution: We argue that this teacher’s culminating practices concurrently re-shaped and re-imagined present and future education reform efforts, and discuss how expansive possibilities of educational justice within a neoliberal context are embodied by teacher-activists of Color who critically and innovatively enact everyday organizing practices.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2020.1768098,,,,,,,,

Silent students and the patterns of their participation in classroom talk,Bishop,2020,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: This study is concerned with the ways that patterns of student participation in classroom talk are constructed, focusing on silent students who participate in whole-class conversation to a limited extent.MethodsWe conducted an ethnographic survey in two ninth-grade classes. We made video recordings of the lessons and interviewed the students and teachers. We observed eight focal silent students—four high-achieving and four low-achieving.FindingsParticipation patterns of high-achieving and low-achieving silent students diverge. High-achieving silent students are often called on by the teacher, and they give extended answers to difficult questions. Low-achieving silent students are called on rarely. High-achieving silent students use silence to consolidate their position as exceptionally capable students; low-achieving silent students use it to consolidate their position as less capable. However, it is possible to engage low-achieving silent students if the teacher notices their momentary spontaneous urge to participate and creates space for their voice in the classroom.ContributionThe paper focuses on the silent students who are often overlooked in studies on classroom talk.

Learning to assemble the hidden bodies: Embodied and emplaced mathematical literacy in transnational migrant activism,Jurow & Zhang,2020,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: : We situate the mobilization of mathematical literacy as a tool to see and redress social and historical dilemmas (Engeström, 2014; Gutiérrez, 2016) rooted in the geo-economic politics of race, gender, and class. Methods: Using collaborative ethnography, we describe how mathematical literacy was mobilized by an activist collective that intervened against violence toward migrant women. Our research considers a long period of development to examine how the activism impacted bodily politics, community, and relevant policies.Findings: Our findings illustrate how the collective of activists led by a migrant woman of color countered the official data that did not reveal marginalized voices. Critical synthesis of embodiment and emplacement allowed us to examine how the mobilization of mathematical literacy became consequential (Jurow et al., 2016) in two interrelated aspects: 1) embodiment, the process through which the historically hidden bodies of migrant women came to be visible and assembled and 2) emplacement, the transformation of a place toward gathering disparate bodies.Contribution: Our work contributes to expanding the geo-political terrain of scholarship in the learning sciences by bringing forth the history of activism led by Filipina migrants in Japan, which in turn shines a light on traditionally masked epistemology key to mobilizing mathematical literacy for solidarity.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2020.1820341,,,[method] NOTE;,,,,,
Assessing the black box of feedback neglect in a digital educational game for elementary school,Brennan,2020,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: : Previous research shows that critical constructive feedback, that scaffolds students to improve on tasks, often remains untapped. The paper’s aim is to illuminate at what stages students provided with such feedback drop out of feedback processing.Methods: In our model, students can drop out at any of five stages of feedback processing: (1) noticing, (2) decoding, (3) making sense, (4) acting upon, and (5) using feedback to make progress. Eye-tracking was used to measure noticing and decoding of feedback. Behavioral data-logging tracked students’ use of feedback and potential progress. Three feedback signaling conditions were experimentally compared: a pedagogical agent, an animated arrow, and no signaling (control condition).Findings: Students dropped out at each stage and few made it past the final stage. The agent condition led to significantly less feedback neglect at the two first stages, suggesting that students who are not initially inclined to notice and read feedback text can be influenced into doing so.Contribution: The study provides a model and method to build more fine-grained knowledge of students’ (non)processing of feedback. More knowledge on at what stages students drop out and why can inform methods to counteract drop out and scaffold more productive and fruitful responses.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2020.1770092,[framework] Structuration Theory;,,[method] Interview Methods;[method] Thematic Analysis;,[setting] informal learning;[subject] computer science / programming;,community;creativity;problem solving;,,,

This emerging line of research, however, has been limited by its geographic focus in North America, a tendency to assume single bounded groups as sites of learning, and limited engagement with theories of power and social change.MethodsWe draw on data from a three-year ethnography of a South African youth-led organizing group, Equal Education (EE), which successfully pressured the national government to adopt an education bill that it had previously resisted. Our inquiry is guided by a broad question: how did EE members learn to build power in this contentious sociopolitical context?FindingsFacilitation and apprenticeship by more experienced near peers in EE supported young people’s understanding of inequality and their participation in nonviolent political activism.

Zones of mathematical play,Erickson,2021,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Most research on mathematical play and learning is focused on early childhood. This study examines how mathematical play and learning manifest in older children in a mathematical videogame designed by the first author, Rolly’s Adventure. We examined how players experienced mathematical play as they played Rolly’s Adventure, with a particular focus on failure paired with feedback. We used video and audio recordings of the players and their bodies, and screen capture of their gameplay. Spoken language, physical gestures, and digital actions were our primary sources of identifying, understanding, and triangulating mathematical play. We found that players pass through five zones of mathematical play that build upon each other and closely interrelate, and that these zones each involve different types of failure, feedback, and learning experiences.

Learning with and beyond the body: The production of mobile architectures in a ballet variations class,Nguyen et al.,2021,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: This paper examines ensemble learning in the context of ballet. We use more-than-representational theory to account for the “invisible” dimensions of ensemble learning, such as sensations, energy, or intensity that bodies sense, circulate, and evoke in others. We illuminate the mobile architectures that emerge in ensemble learning. Mobile architectures emerge when a performance (i.e., dance, athletic, drama), event (i.e., protest, sermon), or environment (i.e., classroom, makerspace) becomes charged as energy is evoked and circulated among bodies.Methods We describe eighteen months of video-recorded inquiry of teaching and learning in a weekly classical ballet variations class. We used interaction analysis to understand how sensations and energies move (among) bodies during learning.Findings Through our analysis, we show: 1) How mobile architectures form and dissolve, particularly as instructional time begins; 2) How audible expressions communicate energy and modulate ensemble learning and 3) How instruction transforms as the ensemble comes together and pulls apart.Contributions This paper contributes a deeper understanding of how learners attune to the relational complexity of learning. It offers accounts of the more-than-representational dimensions of embodiment and calls for further attention beyond the bodies of embodied learning (physical, gestural, tool-mediated dimensions) and toward the intensities, or energies, that those bodies produce together.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2021.2003801,,,,,,,,

“He got a glimpse of the joys of understanding” – The role of epistemic empathy in teacher learning,Rahm et al.,2021,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: : Efforts to promote reform-based instruction have overlooked the import of affect in teacher learning. Drawing on prior work, I argue that teachers’ affective experiences in the discipline are integral to their learning how to teach the discipline. Moreover, I suggest that both affective and epistemological aspects of teachers’ experiences can serve to cultivate their epistemic empathy—the capacity for tuning into and valuing someone’s intellectual and emotional experience within an epistemic activity—in ways that support student-centered instruction. Methods: : Using a case study approach, I examine the learning journey of one preservice teacher, Keith, who after having expressed strong skepticism about responsive teaching, came to value and take up responsive teaching in his instruction. Findings: : The analysis identifies epistemological and affective dynamics in Keith’s interactions with students and in his relationship with science that fostered his epistemic empathy.

The role of participatory identity in learners’ hybridization of activity across contexts,Rainio & Hofmann,2021,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: : We explore how school-based mathematical experiences shape out-of-school mathematical experiences, developing the idea that learners hybridize norms and practices around authority and evaluation across these two contexts. To situate our study, we build on constructs of participatory identity and framing.Methods: Drawing from a large corpus of video records capturing children’s point-of-view, we present a case study of hybridization with two purposively sampled 12-year-old friends—Aimee and Dia—interacting in an out-of-school mathematics playspace. We use interaction analysis to articulate grounded theories of hybridization.Findings: We present a thick description of how children hybridize their activity in out-of-school spaces and how such hybridization is consequential for engagement. Dia’s case illustrates how traditional norms and practices around authority and evaluation can lead to uncertainty and dissatisfaction, while Aimee’s illustrates how playful norms and practices can lead to exploration and pleasure in making. We argue that their school-based mathematics experiences and identities influenced these differences.Contribution: This report strengthens theoretical and methodological tools for understanding how activity and identity development in one context become relevant and shape activity in another by connecting analytic constructs of identity, framing, and hybridizing.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2021.1940186,,,,,,,,
Negotiating identity and agency amidst pedagogical change: The case of student push back,Rau et al.,2021,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: When mathematics teachers embrace the call for pedagogical change, instructional shifts are likely to unfold in complex ways. While we typically view teachers as leading this process, within a figured worlds framework, students play active roles in negotiating the identities, rights, and obligations of all members of a classroom in the midst of pedagogical change.MethodsDrawing on a comparative case study approach, the study examined the case of student push back moves in student-teacher discourse during nine sensemaking mathematics lessons in two fourth grade classrooms.FindingsAnalysis of the case of student push back moves shows how classrooms in pedagogical transition represent not a single coherent figured world, but multiple, clashing figured worlds. Students exercised agency to press the teacher to adhere to obligations to support sensemaking, thus supporting pedagogical change.ContributionThese findings indicate the complexity of negotiations within transitioning classrooms, with implications for understanding how figured worlds evolve and the ways that students participate in pedagogical change.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2021.1954522,,,,,,,,
"No longer an imaginary case: Community, plans, and actions in canoeing rapids",Sendur et al.,2021,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: : We investigate the nature of planning the canoeing of rapids and its reasoning processes, while at the same time advancing a syncretic approach to cognitive and situative theories of learning. Building upon the work of Lucy Suchman, we examine how canoers plan to run rapids and how plans serve as resources for action.Methods: In ethnographically-informed manner, we followed a team of canoers across various contexts of rapid scouting and running. By mounting video cameras on canoeing dyads’ helmets, we captured the team’s discursive construction of plans, how canoe partners took up the collective production of plans to elaborate their own plans, and how plans seemed to function as resources for canoeing action.Findings: Through the analysis of three episodes of rapid running, we articulate detailed descriptions of reasoning processes at the collective, canoeing dyad and individual levels, and draw relationships between them to explain observed canoeing performance in its full complexity.Contribution: We show that drawing on intersections, affinities, and complementarities between principles and theoretical constructs from both cognitive and situative theories of learning may achieve a more holistic, multi-level, and fine-grained description of knowing and learning as ongoing, at once collective and individual achievements.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2021.1936530,,,,,,,,
It takes two to tango: How scientific reasoning and self-regulation processes impact argumentation quality,Sinha,2021,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Improving scientific reasoning and argumentation are central aims of science education. Because of their complex nature, self-regulation is important for successful scientific reasoning. This study provides a first attempt to investigate how scientific reasoning and self-regulation processes conjointly impact argumentation quality.MethodsIn a study with university students (N = 30), we used fine-grained process data of scientific reasoning and self-regulation during inquiry learning to investigate how the co-occurrences between scientific reasoning and self-regulation processes are associated with argumentation quality.FindingsWhen modeling the co-occurrence of scientific reasoning and self-regulation processes using epistemic network analysis, differences between students showing either high or low argumentation quality become apparent. Students who showed high argumentation quality engaged in different scientific reasoning processes together more often than students with low argumentation quality, and they made more connections between self-regulation and scientific reasoning processes.ContributionThese findings offer educational implications for teaching scientific reasoning. Integrating self-regulation and scientific reasoning during instruction could be beneficial for improving scientific reasoning and argumentation.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2021.1966633,,,,,,,,
Young women of color figuring science and identity within and beyond an afterschool science program,Stroupe,2021,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: To attend to the social production of girls of color in science through the lens of history in person and local contentious practice, we propose a relational and nonrepresentational reading of STEM pathways. We invoke the conceptual lenses of wayfaring, knots, and meshwork to highlight the infinite ways of figuring science and becoming a science person in movement. We understand this as a life-long embodied process, entangled and marked by intersectionality and emotions.MethodsDrawing on video recordings, fieldnotes, artifacts, interviews, and focus groups, collected from young women of color participating in an after-school program and over time (2009–2016), we examine moments of figuring science and identity in science.FindingsOur analysis depicts identity work as a meshwork of trails emerging in the flow of the program activities and from deep relations of dignity among the young women of color extending beyond the afterschool program and through time.ContributionsThis paper offers a critique of the linear, unidirectional, and representational pipeline model of STEM education through a focus on wayfaring. In doing so, we call for a reframing of informal science learning experiences as contributing in important ways to a meshwork of lives and learning in science.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2021.1977646,,,,,,,,
Teacher professional dialogues during a school intervention: From stabilization to possibility discourse through reflexive noticing,Calor et al.,2021,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: : Teachers’ limiting conceptualizations of students influence students’ learning opportunities. We analyze teachers’ professional conversations to understand how dialogues can expand teachers’ conceptualizations.Methods: We examine professional dialogues from nine whole-school intervention meetings. Drawing on discursive psychology and activity theoretical notions of learning the study conceptualizes teachers’ collective assumptions as a lived ideology actively sustained by stabilization discourses. We analyze the discursive devices through which the teachers’ talk about their students limits/expands their sense of what is possible in their teaching and their dialogic effects.Findings: Our analysis finds a range of discursive strategies that sustain or re-stabilize the lived ideology. Even when challenged by contrary evidence (e.g., surprises), dilemmatic tensions and reframing repair actions are found to close potential dialogic openings. Importantly, we identify a form of discourse that avoids immediate closure, characterized by sustained reflection on the students’ challenges developing a need to change. We term this reflexive noticing: it is enabled through sustained puzzle, constructing dilemmas as origin of change and discursive consciousness of stabilization.Contribution: We illustrate why contrary evidence often fails to shift limiting conceptualizations about students and show the discursive mechanisms generating possibility knowledge.

Adaptive support for representational competencies during technology-based problem solving in chemistry,Yannier et al.,2021,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: : A key aspect of STEM learning is the use of visual representations for problem solving. To successfully use visuals, students need to make sense of how they show concepts and to fluently perceive domain-relevan information in them. Adding support for sense making and perceptual fluency to problem-solving activities enhances students’ learning of content knowledge. However, students need different types of representational-competency supports, depending on their prior knowledge. This suggests that adaptively assigning students to sense-makingand perceptual-fluency support might be more effective than assigning all students to the same sequence of these supports.Method: We tested this hypothesis in an experiment with 44 undergraduate students in a chemistry course. Students were randomly assigned to a ten-week sequence of problem-solving activities that either provided a fixed sequence of sense-making support and perceptual-fluency support or adaptively assigned these supports based on students’ problem-solving interactions.Findings: Results show that adaptive representational-competency supports reduced students’ confusion and mistakes during problem solving while increasing their learning of content knowledge.Contribution: Our study is the first to show that adaptive support for representational competencies can significantly enhance learning of content knowledge. Given the pervasiveness of visuals, our results may inform general STEM instruction.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2021.1888733,[framework] Learning-by-Design;,[pedagogy] Learning-by-Design (LBD);,[method] Experimental Design;[method] Participant Observation;,[population] child visitors;[setting] museums;[technology] learning analytics;,failure;fairness;,,,

The Content and Language Integrated Learning course was designed using a cognitive apprenticeship model and was based on principles likely to facilitate students’ written historical reasoning.Methods: Conducted as a quasi-experimental study, students in an experimental condition received explicit instruction in historical contextualization and other features of historical reasoning, while those in the control group participated in a version of the course without a focus on historical contextualization. Students’ historical reasoning was measured based on their argumentative document-based writing.Findings: Students’ in both the experimental and control groups significantly improved in all of the areas of historical reasoning that we measured. There was not a significant difference between the groups in the area of historical contextualization, but a further qualitative analysis demonstrated traces of the instructional approach in students’ writing. Unexpectedly, students in the experimental group were significantly better than the control group in terms of writing claims.

Enriching problem-solving followed by instruction with explanatory accounts of emotions,Cherbow & McNeill,2021,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Problem-solving followed by instruction (PS-I) is a powerful design shown to transform students’ conceptual understanding and transfer. Within PS-I, no research has examined how moment-by-moment determinants of affective states impact the problem-solving phase and posttest performance.MethodsI develop a multimodal learning analytics pipeline to (a) infer affective states in PS-I via observable facial movements, (b) understand how the incidence and temporal dynamics of these states vary based on manipulating the problem-solving context with scaffolding strategies (failure-driven, success-driven, none) in an experimental study (N = 132), and (c) assess the extent to which affective states might explain learning.FindingsStudents exposed to failure-driven scaffolding show exclusive dynamics comprising shame, a self-conscious emotion associated with metacognitive and cognitive benefits. Failure-driven scaffolding also creates opportunities for relatively greater emotional displays of knowledge emotions (e.g., surprise, interest). Hostile emotions differentially impact learning in PS-I, with the incidence of anger and disgust showing positive associations and the incidence of contempt showing a negative association. Finally, pleasurable emotions (e.g., happiness) positively associate with isomorphic posttest performance but negatively associate with non-isomorphic and transfer posttests.ContributionOvert changes in facial movements reflective of students experiencing negative emotional states act as catalysts for learning.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2021.1964506,,,,,,,,
Naming and disrupting epistemic injustice across curated sites of learning,Dahn,2021,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Curated sites of learning—places that are created by people to promote formal and informal knowledge and knowledge production practices (such as schools and museums)—are deemed foundational by many societies in assisting children to become knowers. However, curated sites of learning can also uphold ways of knowing that can cause harm to people marginalized from knowledge production, which philosophers describe as epistemic injustice. By looking across fields of research (education and philosophy), I describe how epistemic injustice can be utilized in education research to provide a shared analytical lens for examining curated sites of learning. I name four levels of interaction in which epistemic injustice can occur given their purposeful design by people with power: moment-to-moment interactions, micro (within a site), meso (between local sites) and macro (between sites and national/international policies and rhetoric). I describe how educators and researchers might disrupt epistemic injustice through the examination of curated learning sites and their personal ideas about knowledge.

Intelligent science exhibits: Transforming hands-on exhibits into mixed-reality learning experiences,Halverson & Sawyer,2022,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: : Museum exhibits encourage exploration with physical materials typically with minimal signage or guidance. Ideally children get interactive support as they explore, but it is not always feasible to have knowledgeable staff regularly present. Technologybased interactive support can provide guidance to help learners achieve scientific understanding for how and why things work and engineering skills for designing and constructing useful artifacts and for solving important problems. We have developed an innovative AI-based technology, Intelligent Science Exhibits that provide interactive guidance to visitors of an inquirybased science exhibit. Methods: : We used this technology to investigate alternative views of appropriate levels of guidance in exhibits. We contrasted visitor engagement and learning from interaction with an Intelligent Science Exhibit to a matched conventional exhibit. Findings: : We found evidence that the Intelligent Science Exhibit produces substantially better learning for both scientific and engineering outcomes, equivalent levels of self-reported enjoyment, and higher levels of engagement as measured by the length of time voluntarily spent at the exhibit. Contribution: : These findings show potential for transforming hands-on museum exhibits with intelligent science exhibits and more generally indicate how providing children with feedback on their predictions and scientific explanations enhances their learning and engagement.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2022.2032071,,,,,,,,

Productive failure and learning through argumentation: Building a bridge between two research traditions to understand the process of peer learning,Sengupta-Irving et al.,2022,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Empirical evidence demonstrates the effect of productive failure (Kapur, 2008) on disciplinary knowledge. However, there is no clear theoretical explanation for why this is the case. Empirical evidence on argumentation and education shows the impact of curricular embedded deliberative argumentation on learning. However, these two trends of research have been mainly isolated, with insufficient synergy. Through the analysis of a group of sixth-graders collaborating around problems of natural selection, the aim of this paper is the theoretical exploration of the process of learning in productive failure designs through a focus on argumentative peer dialogue. The paper proposes an articulation of these two fields of research (productive failure and argumentation), which sheds light on both the learning dynamics in productive failure settings and the relevant insights for argumentative designs. The new possibilities for empirical research on learning through peer interaction opened up by these interconnected fields of research are proposed and discussed.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2022.2120398,,,,,,,,
Learning sciences and learning engineering: A natural or artificial distinction?,Sheridan et al.,2022,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"“Learning engineering” has gained popularity as a term connected to the work of learning sciences. However, the nature of that connection is not entirely clear. For some, learning engineering represents distinct, industry-inspired practices enabled by data abundance and digital platformization of learning technologies. That view is presented as one where learning engineers apply learning research that has resided in experimental studies. For others, learning engineering should refer to the use of the full breadth of knowledge developed within the learning sciences research community. This second view is more inclusive of the fundamentally situated, design-oriented, and real-world commitments that are the backbone of the learning sciences, as reflected in this journal. The two views differ even as far as whether the academic field is labeled “learning science” or “learning sciences”. This article examines and articulates these differences. It also argues that without course correction, many who identify with learning engineering will conduct technology-supported learning improvement work that, at its own risk, will neglect the full and necessary scope of what has already been and continues to be discovered in the learning sciences. Moreover, it behooves all to consider recently elevated, but deeply fundamental questions being asked in the learning sciences about what is important to learn and toward what ends. With some more clarity around what is actually encompassed by the learning sciences and how all interested in design and educational improvement can build upon that knowledge, we can make greater collective progress to understanding and supporting human learning.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2022.2100705,,,,,,,,
"“They’re just students.

This study fills this research gap by investigating mathematics faculty’s perceptions of the significance of race and gender to calculus instruction at a large, public, historically white research university.MethodsTheories of colorblind racism and dysconsciousness guided a critical discourse analysis of seven undergraduate calculus faculty’s perceptions of instructional events.FindingsOur analysis revealed two dominant discourses: (i) Race and gender are insignificant social markers in undergraduate calculus; and (ii) Instructional events can be objectively deemed race- and gender-neutral. We illustrate how calculus faculty varyingly engaged these colorblind discourses as well as discourses that challenged such conceptions of instruction. We also highlight how faculty dysconsciousness in reports of instructional practices reflect potential operationalization of dominant discourses that reinforce colorblind racism.ContributionWith limited research on faculty perspectives on racial equity in mathematics, our study documents how color-evasive, gender-neutral discourses among mathematics faculty shape orientations to instruction that reinforce the gatekeeping role of calculus in STEM higher education.

Youth as pattern makers for racial justice: How speculative design pedagogy in science can promote restorative futures through radical care practices,Borge & Xia,2023,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: We examine the development of youth sociopolitical consciousness and agency in an eighth-grade science classroom as students of color engage in critical speculative design activities, exploring the multi-scalar, racial realities and possibilities of the science and engineering of pervasive digital technologies—specifically involving the entanglement of lightwaves and melanin in computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.Methods Through case studies of two girls of color (ES and GS), we analyze the youths’ learning pathways across three instructional phases: threading practices (learners’ sociopolitical interpretation); weaving practices (learners’ coordination of multiple ways of knowing and being in relation to their interpretation); and patternmaking practices (learners’ visions of more just patterns, practices, and politics through speculative design).Findings Our analyses show how youth use their felt, cultural, and community knowledges, as well as their developing scientific knowledge of physics, to confront and analyze manifestations of racial bias in technologies. The findings highlight the significance of teachers’ pedagogical support and providing opportunities for meaningful transdisciplinary science investigations and speculative designing for more just and thriving futures.Contribution The Critical Speculative Design Pedagogy framework developed suggests how such activities in the classroom can cultivate equitable, expansive science learning that is consequential to youth and their communities.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2022.2154158,,,,,,,,
"“We got so much better at reading each other’s energy”: Knowing, acting, and attuning as an improv ensemble",Daniel et al.,2023,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Long-form dramatic improvisation has been investigated as an accomplishment of emergent creativity among an ensemble of “players,” focusing on how the group achieves “group flow” in performance.Methods This article employs ethnographic methods (focus group, interviews, and video-assisted self-interviews) to investigate the case of a musical theater improv group. The analysis focuses on how the group describes its shared modes of knowing, drawing on the group’s history and their interpreted enactment of these modes in an improvised scene.Findings Improvisation in this group requires two inter-related forms of knowing: Shared Social Practice (SSP) and Collaborative Affective Attunement (CAA), where SSP involves definable repertoires, resources, conventions, and techniques, and CAA involves affective sensibility of in-the-moment responding, or affective attunement. These two forms of knowing develop over the course of a group’s history and are entangled in complex ways over the course of performance.Contribution Through a case study of a musical theater improv ensemble, the paper contributes to ongoing efforts to theorize the relationship between embodied experience, social practice, and affect in group knowing with special consideration for the significant role of collaborative affective attunement.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2022.2154157,,,,,,,,

Restorying a Black girl’s future: Using womanist storytelling methodologies to reimagine dominant narratives in computing education,Liukkonen et al.,2023,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Scholarship demonstrates that Black girls’ capacities to imagine possible futures in computing are constrained by narratives of white masculinity and misogynoir embedded within computing. Building on race critical code studies and identity-as-narrative theories, we examine restorying through Black womanist storytelling methodologies for integrating Black girls’ intersectional identities when designing and reimagining their computing futures. We ask: How might womanist storytelling methods support one Black girl in restorying possible computing futures?MethodsWe present a case focused on one study participant, Heather’s, restorying practices situated within a larger workshop wherein marginalized youth reimagined dominant narratives about computer science (CS). This was by creating interactive quilt patches using paper circuits and microcontrollers that challenged dominant narratives of white masculinity and misogynoir normalized throughout the field.FindingsWe see that restorying through womanist storytelling methods allowed Heather to (1) deconstruct narratives of white masculinity and misogynoir throughout CS education by centering Black women’s ways of knowing and doing, and (2) restory the past to enact possible CS futures and identities through computing.ContributionIn the discussion, we address challenges and successes with integrating Black girls’ experiences with speculative methodologies in learning sciences research.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2023.2179847,,,,,,,,

Self-study enhances the learning effect of discussions,Munson & Baldinger,2023,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Academic learning in higher education requires diverse activities such as reading, reviewing, and discussion. However, there are relatively few studies on the effect of the combination of these activities on learning outcomes. In this study, we investigated the combination of self-study and discussions at a selective Korean university.MethodsThe present study compared the two-part instructional sequence of three groups: watching a video lecture (LD) and self-study (SD) groups, both followed by student-led discussions, and reviewing after watching a video lecture (LR) group. We compared test results using verbatim, paraphrased, and transfer items. We also carried out in-depth analyses of dialogs in the discussions.FindingsIn three separate experiments, we found that the discussion groups scored significantly higher than the review group. Moreover, the SD group performed better than the LD group of the two discussion groups. Analyses of dialogue suggest that self-study elicited more active and productive content from the students than lectures, leading to superior performance.ContributionOur results indicate that self-study can significantly enhance the learning effect of discussions.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2023.2185148,,,,,,,,
Interacting with nature in and through boundary crossing learning: A case of bioart-making,Parekh et al.,2023,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: The ongoing transformation of the interplay between human beings and nature calls for new ways of learning. Although established educational practices merging sciences and arts have been studied before, the focus has been mainly on science or technology-discipline-orientated aspects. More research is needed on the characteristics of learning that address nature and the biological through art-based practices.MethodsUtilizing a case study approach, a week-long multidisciplinary project developed around bioart-making, and implemented in a Finnish upper secondary school, was scrutinized. The main data consisted of transcribed participant interviews and textual and visual material from a project blog. The data were analyzed using qualitative theory-driven content analysis to describe and understand the cross-boundary processes and human-nature interactions taking place within the project.FindingsBioart-making constituted as a boundary object bringing together different understandings of nature. Identification, coordination, reflection, and transformation processes on different levels emerged as a part of and as an outcome of bioart-making. In and through these, learners interacted with nature through intertwined events of material-experiential utilization, cognitive knowledge-building, emotional connecting, and philosophical reflection.ContributionThis paper advances the theoretical discussion on integrative art-based practices’ potential, especially in relation to learning that addresses nature and the biological",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2023.2263845,,,,,,,,
Cyborg sociopolitical reconfigurations: Designing for speculative fabulation in learning,Rogers et al.,2023,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Everyday digital technologies play an important role in mediating human activity that is socio-political and humanizing. The everyday cyborg engages in speculative fabulation that is about fantastical new world-making in times of multiple crises. The work presented in this article builds on previous projects that have examined how everyday cultural practices mediate consequential learning that is transformative for communities of color.MethodsTwo social design-based studies draw from ethnographic analysis of two teacher education courses as well as two after-school programs focusing on digital fabrication and making and tinkering. Participants included 22 undergraduate pre-service teachers and 10 middle school students from schools in Latinx communities.FindingsCollaborative cyborg activity, where expertise is distributed, emerged as pre-service teachers and youth collectively engaged with everyday socio-political issues. This article highlights cyborg sociopolitical technical reconfigurations, where learners assembled ideational and material tools to craft objects of learning activity that went beyond those established by schooling and imagined new possible futures.ContributionDesigning learning ecologies for the everyday cyborg, in this case pre-service teachers and non-dominant youth, fosters an engagement with everyday dilemmas in ways that serve as catalysts for further learning and the new world-making of speculative fabulation.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2022.2154159,,,,,,,,
The effect of language on the coherence of children’s conceptions of force,Patel,2023,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: The coherence of learners’ pre-instruction conceptions has been debated for some time. Studies on conceptions of force, specifically, have produced very different results in different contexts around the world. In this study, an integrative theoretical framework linking semantic differences across languages to concept learning in childhood is proposed, motivating the hypothesis that language is a population variable that impacts the coherence of young learners’ conceptions of force.MethodThis study uses the same structured interview developed in a previous study by Ioannides and Vosniadoue but in a new context—the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia—with three groups of elementary school children (7–12 years of age; n = 185): monolingual in Arabic; monolingual in English; and bilingual in Arabic and English.FindingsThe results support the hypothesis that language impacts the coherence of children’s conceptions of force with Arabic monolinguals exhibiting greater coherence than English monolinguals, and bilingual children exhibiting intermediate coherence.ContributionThis paper provides evidence for the effect of semantic differences across languages and the phenomenon of lexical polysemy on the coherence of children’s initial conceptions of force.

Pedagogical sensemaking during side-by-side coaching: Examining the in-the-moment discursive reasoning of a teacher and coach,Tachine & Thomas,2023,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Pedagogical sensemaking, in which teachers attempt to figure something out in relation to teaching and learning, as a form of generative teacher discourse can provide opportunities for teachers to learn. However, much of the research in these areas examines how teachers reason during sustained collegial discourse outside the classroom.MethodsThis exploratory case study of one side-by-side coaching session, in which a coach and teacher collaborate to support both student and teacher learning in the classroom, qualitatively examined the coach-teacher discourse to determine whether and how pedagogical sensemaking can occur in a practice-embedded teacher learning setting.FindingsWe find that generative pedagogical sensemaking is possible despite the contextual constraints. Findings: indicate that teacher-coach interactions included and frequently moved between talk at three altitudes: within, across, and beyond moments of the lesson. The topics of these interactions were complex and connected across the lesson.ContributionThese findings point to particular affordances of practice-embedded settings for generative pedagogical sensemaking. While prior research has emphasized the need for sustained time for sensemaking to support teacher learning, this study expands this conception by finding that, when coupled with shared experiences of pedagogy, brief, cumulative interactions during teaching can also create opportunities for generativity.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2022.2132863,,,[method] INTERLUDE;,,,,,
What pedagogy feels like: Teachers’ development of pedagogical empathy in rehearsal debriefs,Kolodner,2023,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Emotions are inherently intertwined with learning and disciplinary identity, and this relationship demands that teachers attend and respond to students’ emotions. In this study, we forward a theory that the development of pedagogical empathy, or the capacity to understand the implications of student emotions and use emotional data to make adaptive pedagogical decisions, is a component of adaptive expertise.MethodsUsing qualitative methods to analyze the discourse in eight debrief discussions among secondary mathematics teachers following rehearsals of practice, we examine how teachers used this opportunity to generate and use emotional data in support of the development of pedagogical empathy.FindingsWe found that rehearsal debriefs provided an opportunity to make emotional data available to participants in three ways and that teachers then used that emotional data in six ways across the debriefs. Student emotions, both from teachers in the position of students and in consideration of hypothetical students in the classroom, were pervasive in the debrief discussions.ContributionAfter considering the ways in which emotional data were made visible and used, we return to theory to consider how these highlight the opportunities rehearsals offer to develop pedagogical empathy and discuss implications for teacher education and future research.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2023.2269547,,,[method] RESPONSE;,,,,,
Reconfiguring science education through caring human inquiry and design with pets,Reimann,2023,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Natureculture (Fuentes, 2010; Haraway, 2003) constructs offer a powerful framework for science education to explore learners’ interactions with and understanding of the natural world. Technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR) designed to reveal pets’ sensory worlds and companionship with pets can facilitate learners’ harmonious relationships with significant others in naturecultures.MethodsAt a two-week virtual summer camp, we engaged teens in inquiring into dogs’ and cats’ senses using selective color filters, investigations, experience design projects, and understanding how the umwelt (von Uexküll, 2001) of pets impacts their lives with humans. We qualitatively analyzed participants’ talk, extensive notes, and projects completed at the workshop.FindingsWe found that teens engaged in the science and engineering practices of planning and carrying out investigations, constructing explanations and designing solutions, and questioning while investigating specific aspects of their pets’ lives. Further, we found that teens checking and taking pets’ perspectives while caring for them shaped their productive engagement in these practices. The relationship between pets and humans facilitated an ecological and relational approach to science learning.ContributionOur findings suggest that relational practices of caring and perspective-taking coexist with scientific practices and enrich scientific inquiry.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2023.2228990,[framework] Design-Based Research (DBR);,[pedagogy] Design-Based Research (DBR);,[method] Comparative Analysis;[method] Design-Based Research (DBR);,[setting] higher education;[technology] data science tools;,collaboration;epistemic cognition;,,,

Methodological challenges of research on interdisciplinary learning,Clark et al.,2024,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"I begin the commentary by identifying some methodological challenges in interdisciplinary learning research and describe how the contributions to the special issue address these. The fact that interdisciplinary learning is collaborative, long-lasting, and distributed necessitates using rich data sources and mainly qualitative forms of analysis. The impossibility of experimental comparisons led the researchers to adopt an ecological perspective, focusing on multi-level causal pathways rather than linear cause-and-effect relationships. Furthermore, I propose establishing an “object commons” for sharing research on interdisciplinary learning, suggesting metadata standards like PROV for describing digital provenance. Reconstructing the provenance of (digital) knowledge objects resembles historical analysis. I therefore explore further how narratives can serve as scientific explanations, drawing parallels between narrative structures and graph-based provenance notation. I argue for the refinement of narrative formats using digital provenance methods to enhance systematic analysis and sharing of research findings. In conclusion, addressing the methodological challenges that are indigenous to research on interdisciplinary learning has the potential to advance the methodology arsenal of the Learning Sciences and of educational research more generally.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2024.2354153,,,[method] Design Thinking Research;[method] Content Analysis;,,ambiguity;,,,
An ecological paradigm of interdisciplinary learning: Implications for design,Muukkonen & Kajamaa,2024,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"In this commentary, I offer my insights from the Special Issue—Beyond disciplinary engagement: researching the ecologies of interdisciplinary learning—which, in my view, reframes interdisciplinarity. In contrast to the cognitivist paradigm—where research is largely concerned with learning processes that lead to an individual’s cognitive interdisciplinary learning outcome—in the ecological paradigm research is primarily concerned with the interdisciplinary learning processes that occur within groups. To address a concern regarding the usefulness of design principles in this framing, I use an approach for extending the applicability of design principles by augmenting them with designers’ dilemmas and solutions in various contexts. Three main dilemmas are discussed: (1) How to ensure students have access to disciplinary knowledge and epistemic resources, as they embark on the interdisciplinary work? (2) How to support the fine-grained socio-material-cultural processes involved in interdisciplinary learning between diverse learners, levels and/or disciplinary expertise? (3) How to build on, but also push the boundaries of existing infrastructures to develop new routines, social networks, physical and digital infrastructures to accommodate interdisciplinary learning from K-12 through higher education?

Toward epistemic justice in socio-scientific decision-making: How youth make sense of lively COVID-19 and vaccines data,Shtechman et al.,2024,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Studies of socio-scientific decision-making in times of crisis are in their infancy. This study investigates how minoritized youth engage and make sense of newly developed COVID-19 vaccines and their intersections with the evolving multi-pandemic. Guided by theories of lively data, data sense and epistemic injustice, we center the experience of four Palestinian Arab minority youth in Israel context throughout the ongoing pandemic.MethodsOur analysis of long-form interviews and experience sampling was based on critical grounded theory. We also used counter-narrative to bring witness, capture youth first-hand experience, and recenter marginal knowledge.FindingsOur findings show how youth come to understand the multidimensional nature of the crisis through their first-hand sensory experiences with COVID-19 data. They used their agentic positions with data to make their lively data matter. Their sense- and decision-making shifted as the pandemic and reflected how they understood it as a health hazard, vaccine efficacy, the political, scientific narratives and policies regarding the vaccine.

Curiosity to Question: Tracing productive engagement in an interdisciplinary course-based research experience,Novis-Deutsch et al.,2024,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Course-based research experiences (CBREs) are highly valued for science learning and research. Most are discipline-centered, but there is a great deal of interest in developing them to promote interdisciplinarity. Yet, we have much to learn about how CBREs work, and even more to learn about how disciplinary diversity operates as an element of design to promote learning and research.MethodThis mixed methods case study triangulates data on student experience, research networks, research artifacts and fieldnotes from participant observation to understand how disciplinary diversity factors into productive engagement for learning and research in an interdisciplinary course-based research experience (I-CBRE).FindingsA common boundary object (scientific paper) mediated developmental interactions among individuals both within and beyond the course. The boundary object also facilitated the productive engagement of students as instrumental actors in broader interdisciplinary research networks.ContributionThis study shows how an “object tracing” approach can be used to examine productivity in disciplinarily diverse scientific contexts, and reveals some of the distinctly syncretic moves that participants deploy to make progress as learners and researchers.

Youth took a pre- and post-assessment; we analyzed results using quantitative tests of significance. We used an established sorting task to gather youth perspectives of the tools as identity texts through design markers of gendered identities within the toolkits. We examined the relationship between learning outcomes and the gendered design components of the toolkits.FindingsToolkits that privilege feminine or artistic elements significantly impacted learning more than traditional toolkits used in schools, which showed little to no significant learning gains. We relate this to the inextricability of materiality and the gendered identities of these tools and materials.ContributionThis study shows how arts-based or feminine-coded tools can be more effective for teaching and learning, serving as a counter to common resistance to adopting such tools and materials for STEM learning.

Mechanistic reasoning in biology among elementary school children: Epistemic criteria for evaluation and construction,Tofel-Grehl et al.,2024,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: In science, mechanistic explanations play a crucial role in elucidating phenomena, highlighting the significance of mechanistic reasoning in science education. Studies in this field offer conflicting views on children’s mechanistic reasoning, with some suggesting that children tend to use other non-mechanistic types of reasoning.MethodsWe used a mixed methods exploratory research design to investigate the evaluation and construction of explanations by children in grades 2–6. Children were asked to construct explanations for a biological phenomenon and to evaluate mechanistic and non-mechanistic explanations for three other biological phenomena.FindingsChildren who participated in this study could construct mechanistic explanations, even 2nd graders. Moreover, they accepted more mechanistic explanations than non-mechanistic ones and preferred them over others. Two epistemic criteria seem to contribute to this evaluation process: “explanatory power” assists the children in differentiating between mechanistic and non-mechanistic explanations, and “information accuracy” leads them to reject explanations that contradict their prior knowledge. We found that the accuracy criterion is grounded in knowledge of biology and thinking tools such as thinking across levels.ContributionOur results highlight the epistemic perspective that elementary school children adopt when evaluating mechanistic and non-mechanistic explanations of biological phenomena and their emerging potential for mechanistic reasoning.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2024.2432682,[framework] Queer Theory;,[pedagogy] Social Design Experiment (SDE);,[method] Queer Methodology;[method] Social Design Experiment (SDE);,[population] LGBTQ+ youth;[setting] informal learning;[setting] maker spaces;[subject] STEM;,belonging;identity;imagination;,,,

However, a historical review of the rise of disciplines points at their compartmentalization in schools. An analysis of core construct categories of three disciplines, shows that this compartmentalization may decrease when dialogic argumentation is enacted. This background led us to launch an interdisciplinary program in schools. In previous publications, we identified multiple constraints in its implementation and listed design principles for affording interdisciplinary dialogic argumentation.MethodWe adopt a narrative approach to analyze classroom talk, and ask whether and how interdisciplinary processes emerge in this talk.FindingsStudents maintain dialogic argumentation around Interdisciplinary Social Dilemmas, but guidance is necessary for integrating knowledge from different disciplines. When the teacher is attentive to student’s unarticulated references to disciplinary ideas, she may subtly guide the emergence of interdisciplinary dialogic argumentation. Often, the teacher misses those opportunities and declaims the integration of knowledge in a non-dialogic talk.ContributionDialogic Education is crucial for the success of interdisciplinary programs in schools, but the actual emergence of interdisciplinary processes depends on the handling of organizational and institutional constraints, on huge design efforts, and on subtle guidance.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2024.2344809,[framework] Ecological Perspective;[framework] Learning Ecologies;,,[method] Ecological Perspective;,[setting] higher education;[setting] K–12 education;[setting] learning ecologies;,,,,
Humanizing Co-design through attention to educators’ affective and relational experiences,Ben-Dor & Heyd-Metzuyanim,2024,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Co-design can be challenging and rewarding as educators explore new roles and ideas. Accounts of co-design rarely examine educators’ affective and relational experiences, nor investigate scaffolds for creating humanizing environments. We asked: How did affect and relationship show up in co-design for educators?, How did the affirmation of affect and relationship in the co-design process support the movement of ideas and practices across scales of practice?, How did the movement of ideas and practices facilitate the expansion of the object (to design a compassion course)?MethodsWe analyzed meeting transcripts, field notes, artifacts, interviews, and reflections from a co-design project where educators and researchers developed a course sequence on compassion and dignity in schools.FindingsEducators discussed affective experiences, including those connected to challenging interactions. Discussing obstacles to compassion contributed to strengthening the co-design community and educators’ positive experience of co-design. Attention to affective experiences supported educators to connect compassion to their lives, invited learning across scales of practice, and expanded their vision for shared work.ContributionAttention to affective and relational aspects of co-design strengthens engagement in the co-design process, inviting more equitable participation and creating humanizing design environments, and thus should be a central component of participatory work.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2024.2318557,,,,,,,,

“I can be the weird STEM kid who is also gay”: Queer rightful presence in STEM making,Chen et al.,2024,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: STEM participation is often associated with the disenfranchisement of historically marginalized individuals. Disrupting these standing injustices to establish rightful presence with equitable opportunity, access, and cultural standing to shape and pursue STEM endeavors in ways that are inclusive of individuals’ identities is a critical objective. However, research to understand and facilitate STEM experiences of queer youth what are also navigating their own relationships with gender- and heteronormativity is limited. Making—employing STEM to design artifacts in an informal learning environment—can disrupt conventional approaches to STEM activity in ways that support inclusive STEM engagement through crafting and personalized design.MethodThis social design experiment examines the ways in which the design of maker activities and spaces can support queer rightful presence within STEM spaces.FindingsWe found that maker communities can frame and collectively engage issues of identity formulation that are both dynamic and fluid in nature as part of bolstering STEM affinity. As participants’ multifaceted identities unfolded through making projects that deliberately invited identity into design, they established rightful presence for intertwined queer and STEM identities.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2024.2409101,,,,,,,,
"Interpersonal, intrapersonal, and cognitive tactics: A thematic analysis of adults’ 21 <sup>st</sup> century learning management",Chen,2024,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: “21st century learning” is reliant on not only cognitive competencies such as problem-solving, but also interpersonal (e.g., collaboration) and intrapersonal (e.g., self-regulation) competencies. Building on research in K-12/undergraduate contexts, we investigated cognitive, interpersonal, and intrapersonal learning tactics in a sample of working adults.MethodWe conducted 75 interviews with adults in an online Master’s in Computer Science (CS) program. We used thematic analysis to organize participants’ learning tactics into five key strategies and interpreted strategy/tactic use in the context of a well-known 21st century learning framework.FindingsInterpersonal tactics were perceived as critical across domains, while the relative salience of intrapersonal and cognitive tactics differed depending on the nature of the task. This highlights: (1) critical differences between effective strategies for managing learning itself versus non-learning demands and (2) the value of “making space” for learning alongside other domains of adult life (e.g., work/family).ContributionsWe differentiate between tactics employed to master course content (e.g., via educational technology) and those facilitating the development of a supportive learning environment (e.g., via regulation of resources across domains and over time), show utility of the 21st century learning framework for working adults in CS, and discuss issues of identity and learning management.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2024.2303777,,,,,,,,
Beyond disciplinary engagement: Researching the ecologies of interdisciplinary learning,Deekens et al.,2024,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"The importance of engaging students with complex societal challenges has led to the adoption of various interdisciplinary teaching and learning practices in both K-12 and higher education. However, interdisciplinary learning is one of the most complex domains of contemporary educational practice, and, despite its significance, remains significantly undertheorized and under-researched. This Special Issue highlights empirical research efforts toward understanding interdisciplinary learning in its complexity. It simultaneously aims to 1) advance ecological perspectives that encompass concepts and methodologies for studying complex heterogeneous learning practices and 2) apply these perspectives to the research of interdisciplinary learning—of how people learn across and beyond disciplines. This introduction provides a historical context for interdisciplinary learning, introduces an ecological stance toward researching learning across and beyond disciplines, and reviews critical theoretical and methodological challenges within interdisciplinary learning, arguing that the field of the learning sciences is well-positioned to address these challenges.

“Seeing power” between young people and conservation professionals in the design of a community-based watershed monitoring initiative,,2024,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Community-based monitoring provides a forum for diverse stakeholders to co-construct knowledge relevant to building social-ecological resilience. However, power asymmetries between these actors can privilege the perspectives of dominant groups, while preventing non-dominant perspectives from informing conservation science.MethodsThis study investigates a workshop series intended to support young people in designing a watershed monitoring initiative rooted in their own interests with respect to a large dam removal in their community. We use interaction analysis to examine whose ideas are taken up in discussions among young people, educators, conservation professionals, and education researchers.FindingsPower dynamics that privilege the contributions of credentialed professionals over those of young people can constrain collective learning processes while simultaneously generating tensions that allow for expansive learning to occur. Facilitation practices and other pedagogical moves play an important role in either further entrenching or disrupting hierarchies between youth and community partners.ContributionOur analysis reveals how careful attention to interactional dynamics—both as a research method and as a pedagogical practice—can make visible and disrupt epistemic hierarchies in multi-stakeholder learning environments.

Investigating the interplay of epistemological and positional framing during collaborative uncertainty management,Adah Miller & Li,2024,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Dealing with uncertainties is inherent in the engineering design process and often poses challenges for young learners. This necessitates providing learners with adequate support to navigate their uncertainties effectively. However, achieving this requires a deeper understanding of the factors influencing learners’ uncertainty management processes.MethodIn this paper, we analyze learners’ framing of uncertain situations in collaborative engineering design tasks. Using the case study method, we explore two framing dimensions—epistemological and positional—to understand their impact on collaborative uncertainty management processes. Specifically, we examine how learners’ framing dynamically shifts during uncertainty management activities by analyzing two contrasting cases from a sixth-grade classroom where groups tackled an engineering design problem, employing interaction analysis.FindingsLearners’ epistemological and positional framings are intertwined, collectively influencing their own and their team members’ uncertainty management actions. Additionally, contextual factors such as mentor intervention, early success, affect induced by prolonged failure, and time constraints can prompt shifts in learners’ framing, both in productive and unproductive manners.ContributionThe paper provides nuanced insights into how learners’ evolving epistemological orientations and positioning influence uncertainty management, offering practical insights into supporting learners’ uncertainty management processes in problem-solving contexts such as engineering design.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2024.2312163,,[pedagogy] Problem-Based Learning (PBL);[pedagogy] Project-Based Learning (PjBL);,[method] Case Study Research;[method] Interview Methods;,[subject] STEM;,authenticity;,,,
Disciplinary skills are not enough: Resituating historical thinking within students’ racialized and linguistic experiences,Jurow et al.,2024,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Drawing from research with 11th-grade history students, the authors illustrate how students’ racial/ethnic and language experiences influence their analysis of Mexican American discrimination. Latinx students’ experiences with white privilege helped them understand why 1940s Mexican Americans claimed whiteness to access better schools. However, students’ experiences with instruction for Emergent Bilingual (EB) students interfered with seeing language segregation as a proxy for racial/ethnic discrimination.MethodsThe first author collected three days of classroom field notes, conducted 15 student interviews, and collected 177 student work samples. The authors used a grounded theory approach to identify how students’ racialized experiences help or hinder their historical analysis.FindingsThe findings suggest that students’ racialized experiences interplay with the disciplinary concepts of contextualization and presentism. Our findings complicate how disciplinary concepts alone do not sufficiently help students analyze how systemic racism manifests differently across historical moments.ContributionThis paper offers implications for how historical thinking skills can make space for students’ racialized and linguistic experiences.

Learning and constructions of us and them in teachers’ collaborative groups,Sarfati-Shaulov & Vedder-Weiss,2024,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Many studies have pointed to the importance of trust and inclusiveness in teachers’ collaborative groups. Here, we investigate how teachers negotiate dividing lines between “us” and “them” in moment-to-moment interaction. We also examine relationships between these negotiations, local arrangements, and teachers’ opportunities to learn.MethodsWe analyzed video recordings of two teacher groups, both oriented toward equitable mathematics instruction. We coordinated microinteractional analyses of four episodes with analyses of local arrangements that shaped interaction.FindingsIn both groups, participants worked to construct a sense of solidarity as “us.” Yet the threat of being positioned outside this “us”—as one of “them”—narrowed opportunities for teachers in both groups to engage in the vulnerable work of grappling with tensions and contradictions together. The salience of this threat was greater in one group than the other, however. We trace this to local arrangements that were differently designed, with different affordances for constructing “us” and “them.”ContributionThe social negotiation of exclusion and belonging in teacher groups is highly consequential for teacher learning. Better supporting teacher learning is not just a matter of remediating individuals’ skills or dispositions; it requires learning environments designed to support engagement with the tensions inherent in teaching..",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2024.2370003,[framework] Situative Perspective;,,[method] Discourse Analysis;[method] Narrative Inquiry;[method] Coding and Categorization;,[setting] in-school PD teams;,affect;collaboration;efficacy;emergent reasoning;,,,

We investigated how students framed online evaluations while learning to read laterally, how students’ frames corresponded with their credibility assessments, and how teachers prompted and responded to students’ frames.FindingsWhile students frequently framed online evaluations as opportunities to check what credible others think through lateral reading, we found that students also frequently framed evaluation tasks as opportunities to gut check if the information made sense by relying on personal resources and weak heuristics. Students’ frames shifted as they had opportunities to practice lateral reading.

We explore stories teachers tell that narrate pedagogical emotions in professional development (PD) conversations and examine whether and how these emotions are leveraged as collaborative learning resources.MethodWe analyzed in-school PD discourse in 66 teacher team meetings, coding 128 stories that narrated teacher emotions and the responses they elicited from colleagues. We then zoomed in on one focal episode, in which emotions were leveraged for learning, demonstrating how narrated emotions may afford collaborative teacher inquiry.FindingsWe found that, in general, teachers tended to narrate and respond more to negative emotions than to positive ones. However, discussing students, they narrated more positive than negative emotions. Overall, the findings demonstrate the affordances of narrated emotions for teacher learning and the constraints imposed by the discourse emotional rules.ContributionWe suggest that frameworks for teacher learning should emphasize not only teacher pedagogical reasoning and action but also emotions, treating pedagogical emotions as objects for collaborative inquiry.

Teachers as agentic synthesizers:Recontextualizing personally meaningful practices from professional development,Schneider et al.,2025,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Teacher learning from professional development (PD) remains undertheorized. Most PD studies focus on its content or structure to gauge learning, leaving substantive gaps in our understanding of teacher learning processes and the role of contexts. Therefore, we investigate teachers’ learning as they take practices from PD and adapt them to their own settings.MethodsUsing ethnographic methods and taking a situative perspective, we offer an in-depth comparative case study of two teachers’ PD learning over time and across contexts.FindingsWe find that teachers’ learning was shaped in the process of recontextualizing practices from PD into their classrooms through agentic synthesis of these practices with contextual particulars: namely, salient problems of practice, learning in other contexts, idealized teacher identities, contextually situated goals, challenges of implementation, and other related affordances and constraints. Through this synthesis, they developed what we call personally meaningful practices, which may or may not reflect the intent of the original PD practice.ContributionOur work contributes to theory of how teachers’ learning occurs by illuminating agentic synthesis as a core process resulting from teachers recontextualizing practices from PD.

We collected multiple data sources including pre and post surveys, post interviews, and video recordings of all sessions.FindingsOur analysis found that teachers’ instructional vision shifted away from traditional instruction and toward a vision that empowered student voice and increased equitable opportunities for science. Furthermore, teachers raised concerns about this vision because of the newness of the approach and unease about their specific students and context.ContributionCritical design features of the curriculum-based professional learning workshop included the following: Offering the student perspective, providing images of classroom instruction, and supporting collaborative teacher reflection.

This approach explores how MTR mediums and representational discourse shape power relations within the classroom.FindingsOur findings reveal that while representational discourse often reinforced existing hierarchies, MTR mediums offered marginalized students subtle yet impactful ways to resist hegemonic power structures and assert agency. Moments of circulating affect, kinesthetic togetherness, and emerging mobile architectures provided opportunities for subjugated knowledge to surface, disrupting dominant narratives.ContributionThis research demonstrates how resistance and agency manifest in learning communities marked by diverse and conflicting narratives.

How physics students build computational literacy by creating computational literature,Hamilton et al.,2025,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Computation has revolutionized science and is gradually being integrated into science teaching and learning. However, theoretical frameworks for understanding how students learn to use computation as a disciplinary tool are currently underdeveloped.MethodsIn this study, we propose computational literacy as a productive theoretical lens on this subject, with a particular focus on how people engage with and write computational literature. This theory views computation as a literacy consisting of material, cognitive, and social elements, to which we add the notion of computational literature that has epistemic and communicative aspects. We use this perspective, operationalized through both narrative case study and conjecture mapping methodologies, to analyze the cases of two pairs of students writing computational essays in an intermediate physics course.FindingsThrough these case studies we see the pairs leveraging elements of their existing computational literacy to both engage with and produce computational literature in their discipline. This, in turn, helps them to adopt the practices of computational scientists and deepen their computational literacy.ContributionThis study shows the usefulness of computational literacy as a framework for understanding computational learning within a discipline and elaborates on the role that computational literature plays in that process.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2025.2494791,,,[method] TRIBUTE;,,,,,

I don’t want to grow up.” Young children’s video interpretations of their mathematical play,Chang & Philip,2025,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: : While there exists a large body of research on the benefits of play in supporting children’s mathematical learning, the vast majority of such research has been conducted in early childhood or informal contexts, rather than formal K-12 schools. Moreover, this research has predominantly focused on adults’ perspectives of children’s play. Seeking to bring young children’s voices into methodological and design considerations, this study investigates children’s video interpretations of their mathematical play. Methods: : Leveraging data from a larger project that explores the integration of play in elementary mathematics classrooms, I draw upon sociocultural theory and critical childhood studies, as well as video-elicited interviews with four children, in order to examine play as both a context for mathematics learning, as well as a text for reading the mathematical worlds of young children. Findings: : Findings suggest that the four children drew upon sophisticated frames when making sense of video data, including situated conditions, networks of care, affective experiences, tangible fulfillment, and mathematical curiosities. Contribution: : Insights from this study challenge traditionally narrow perspectives of young children as merely consumers of knowledge, who learn in order to “become adults,” and instead situates them as active sense-makers, whose noticings may better position us to design mathematics learning environments according to their insights and vantage points.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2025.2481844,,,,,,,,
Applying the PAIR-C Framework to foster deep understanding and address misconceptions in science education,Germinaro,2025,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Understanding complex scientific phenomena, such as natural selection, requires engaging with emergent patterns and causal mechanisms, which are often misunderstood due to persistent misconceptions. Traditional instruction may not adequately support conceptual change in this domain.MethodsThis study explores the integration of the PAIR-C (Pattern, Agents, Interactions, Relations, and Causality) Framework with agent-based models (ABMs) to enhance conceptual understanding of natural selection. Fifty undergraduate students participated online and were randomly assigned to two groups. One group received instruction that follows the PAIR-C framework, while the other was taught using traditional Darwinian principles, both employing ABM scenarios. Assessments included pre-posttests, video recordings, surveys, and interviews, with misconceptions analyzed through epistemic network analysis (ENA).FindingsThe PAIR-C approach significantly improves students’ deep understanding of natural selection, more effectively reducing misconceptions compared to the traditional method. Further, ENA revealed distinct characteristics of misconception between the groups, with the intervention group showing a more focused pattern compared to the control group. Video analysis also showed different types of interactions occurring during the PAIR-C modules.ContributionThis study demonstrates that the PAIR-C framework, when combined with ABMs, can foster deeper scientific understanding and conceptual change, with implications for broader application in complex systems education.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2025.2546471,,,,,,,,

Implementation as distributed sensemaking and adaptation: Understanding how an interest-driven STEAM learning environment maintains integrity across diverse contexts,Kessner et al.,2025,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: Much of learning sciences research focuses on the design of learning innovations. However, curricula developed by learning scientists are seldomly widely adopted. One reason is that scaling programs beyond local, carefully tended contexts is difficult and is often unsuccessful. This problem suggests a need for research aimed at understanding how learning innovations scale beyond initial implementations.MethodsWe take a distributed sensemaking approach to analyzing the micro-level processes through which actors make sense of and align themselves with new programs. We examine one learning innovation, FUSE Studios, an integrated suite of STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math) learning activities, which has spread from two afterschool implementations to over 250, primarily in-school implementations. We present an analysis of classroom video and interviews with students and teachers from 17 focal schools, including a detailed case analysis of one school.FindingsOur findings demonstrate how distributed sensemaking and adaptation among networks of humans and non-humans shaped local implementations and how, despite local adaptations, the program was able to maintain integrity of implementation, delivering similar experiences to students across contexts.ContributionThese findings improve our understanding of how learning innovations scale and demonstrate the value of a distributed sensemaking perspective on implementation processes.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2025.2548546,,,,,,,,

"Culturally and Linguistically Sustaining Formative Assessment in science and engineering: Highlighting multilingual girls’ linguistic, epistemic, and spatial brilliances",,2025,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: This study advances understandings of formative assessment by introducing the Culturally and Linguistically Sustaining Formative Assessment (CLSA) framework, grounded in relational and embodied perspectives and culturally sustaining pedagogy. While formative assessment is widely recognized as a process for supporting learning, less is known about how it can be enacted in culturally and linguistically sustaining ways.MethodsDrawing on a case study of a science and engineering teacher and three multilingual girls from Afro-Brazilian and Portuguese backgrounds in a summer STE(A)M program at a newcomer school in the Northeastern United States, we apply the CLSA framework to analyze moment-to-moment interactions and examine the nature, form, and function of the teacher’s discursive and embodied moves. We analyze how these moves become consequential in sustaining students’ disciplinary engagement through CLSA-aligned practices such as asking questions, providing feedback, and interpreting students’ actions.FindingsFindings demonstrate how CLSA, when enacted through a proleptic belief in students’ competencies and relational attunement to their translanguaging, embodied interaction, and epistemic flow, surfaces forms of competencies, foundational to STEM disciplines.ContributionThe study offers insights for how the CLSA approach can serve as a relational and dignity-oriented pedagogical process that recognizes and sustains the brilliance of youth historically marginalized in STEM.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2025.2529170,,,,,,,,
Interaction of avatar identity and opportunities to practice historical reasoning in a history videogame:A quantitative ethnography,,2025,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: We build on prior research suggesting the made-for-school, history-oriented videogame Mission US offers entry-level opportunities for students to practice “thinking like historians”—a phrase the game uses to indicate key historical reasoning and thinking skills.MethodsWe leverage quantitative ethnography (QE) and epistemic network analysis (ENA) to examine how these opportunities co-occur.FindingsWe find significant differences between two groups of game missions focusing on different historical time periods with different player characters. One group appears to focus more heavily on historical thinking and reasoning, while a second appears to constrain historical thinking and reasoning to a function of protagonists’ marginalized identities. Further exploration of these differences revealed the game’s developers appear to have designed an ideological game world that positions White avatars to more freely engage in historical thinking and reasoning practices, while Black, Brown, and Indigenous avatars are substantively constrained in doing so.ContributionThis study illustrates the power of QE and ENA to uncover hard-to-see aspects of the ideological worlds baked into teaching and learning environments, especially those potentially harmful to young people’s capacity to see themselves within disciplinary Discourses.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2025.2544622,,,,,,,,
Aspects of the social construction of causal reasoning,,2025,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Background: The value of causal reasoning is widely appreciated by educators, yet little research has been dedicated to determining how it develops in social contexts. This study examined children’s construction of causal reasoning during collaborative discussions in elementary school classrooms and investigated whether they were able to transfer causal reasoning displayed during the discussions to individual tasks.MethodsMultilink causal chain models were tracked in 24 collaborative discussions involving 160 underserved fifth-graders, 154 individually written essays about the question addressed in the discussion, and 95 individual oral interviews about an analogous question. Path analyses were conducted to document connections between learning processes and products.FindingsRecurrent patterns of multilink causal reasoning were identified in 92% of the collaborative discussions. Students were found to use what they had learned about the construction of multilink causal chains in collaborative groups in an independently written essay and a knowledge transfer interview. Peer modeling played a key role in fostering the transfer of multilink causal reasoning for children who could not produce causal chains themselves.ContributionOverall, this analysis of the social construction of multilink causal chains provides distinctive new evidence that enabling meaningful interaction among children promotes higher-level cognitive development.",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2025.2544619,,,,,,,,
Embodiment in mathematics teaching and learning: evidence from learners' and teachers' gestures,,,Journal of the Learning Sciences,"Gestures are often taken as evidence that the body is involved in thinking and speaking about the ideas expressed in those gestures. In this article, we present evidence drawn from teachers’ and learners’ gestures to make the case that mathematical knowledge is embodied.We argue that mathematical cognition is embodied in 2 key senses: It is based in perception and action, and it is grounded in the physical environment. We present evidence for each of these claims drawn from the gestures that teachers and learners produce when they explain mathematical concepts and ideas. We argue that (a) pointing gestures reflect the grounding of cognition in the physical environment, (b) representational gestures manifest mental simulations of action and perception, and (c) some metaphoric gestures reflect body-based conceptual metaphors. Thus, gestures reveal that some aspects of mathematical thinking are embodied.",https://www.academia.edu/download/30874206/2012_Alibali_Nathan_JLS_Embodiment_Instruction_Gesture.pdf,,,,,,,,
